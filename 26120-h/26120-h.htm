<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This little book has been compiled to emphasise
and accentuate the distinct awakening of English
women and Needlecraft Artists to the beauty of
the ancient laces and embroideries which we own
in the magnificent historic collections in our great
public Museums.</p>

<p>We are fortunate in possessing in the Victoria
and Albert Museum monumental specimens of both
lace and needlework. Among the sumptuous lace
collection there are most perfect specimens of the
art of lace-making, and priceless pieces of historic
embroidery made when England was first and foremost
in the world in the production of Ecclesiastical
embroidery.</p>

<p>The lace collection particularly, without compare,
is illustrative of all that is best in this delightful
art, being specially rich in magnificent pieces that
can never be again obtained. These have mostly
been given, or left as legacies, to the Museum by
collectors and enthusiasts who have made this
fascinating hobby the quest of their lives. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
addition to the collection formed by the generosity
of the donors, the authorities have exercised a
very catholic judgment in selecting the choicest
and most illustrative examples of the lace-maker's
craft.</p>

<p>In the section devoted to embroideries, more
particularly English (as it is with our own country's
needlework I propose to deal), nothing more glorious
in the Nation's art records can be found than the
masterpieces of embroidery worked by the great
ladies, the abbesses and nuns of the Medi&aelig;val
period. In almost every other branch of art England
has been equalled, if not excelled, by Continental
craftsmen; but in this one instance, up to the
Reformation, English work was sought after far
and wide, and as <i>opus Anglicum</i> formed part of
church furnishing and priestly vestments in every
great cathedral in Italy, Spain, and France.</p>

<p>It cannot be too soon realised that, as with old
furniture, porcelain, and silver, much of the finest
embroideries of England, and a vast quantity of the
ancient laces of Italy, France, and Belgium are being
slowly but surely carried off to the New World.
American dollars are doing much to rob not only
the Old Country of the fairest flowers of her garden,
but the Continent of their finest and best examples
of the genius of the past. The Vanderbilts and the
Astors, among others, possess immense fortunes in
lace, whilst that omnivorous collector Mr. J. Pierpont
Morgan gives fabulous sums for any fine old relic
of embroidery. Many pieces of both classes of
needlecraft have found a permanent home in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
Metropolitan Museum of New York, and are lost
for ever to the English student.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, a pleasant duty to add my little
quota of information to the study of these fascinating
and exquisite branches of fine art which so specially
appeal to all women by their dainty grace and delightful
handicraft. I hope I may arouse some little
enthusiasm in my countrywomen in the study of the
past glories of both subjects, and in the possibility of
once again becoming first and foremost in the latter
branch.</p>

<p>I beg to acknowledge the pleasure and help I have
received from the perusal of the late Mrs. Bury
Palliser's exhaustive "History of Lace," and Lady
Alford's "History of Needlework," and Dr. Rock's
invaluable books on "Ecclesiastical Embroidery."</p>

A BRIEF HISTORY OF LACE</h2>

(685 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>)&mdash;Drawn Thread and Cutworks&mdash;Venetian Lace&mdash;Flanders
Lace&mdash;French Laces&mdash;English Lace.</p></div>


<p>In every other art or craft we can search the
history of ages and find some vestiges or beginnings
among the earlier civilisations. Possibly owing to
the exquisite fragility of Lace, there is a complete
absence of data earlier than that of Egypt. The
astonishing perfection in art handicrafts of all descriptions
which we find in China many hundreds of
years before the Christian era shows no vestiges of
a manufacture of lace; but, in the tombs of ancient
Egypt, garments have been discovered with the edges
frayed and twisted into what we may call a primitive
lace, and in some of the Coptic embroideries threads
have been drawn out at intervals and replaced with
those of coloured wools, making an uncouth but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
striking design. Netting must have been understood,
as many of the mummies found at Thebes and
elsewhere are discovered wearing a net to hold or
bind the hair; and also, a fine network, interspersed
with beads, is often discovered laid over the breast,
sometimes having delightful little blue porcelain
deities strung amongst their meshes.</p>

<p>These early vestiges, however, are in no way representative
of the later exquisite fabrics which we now
know and recognise as Lace. Far nearer to them, as
an art, are the early gold and silver laces of simple
design found amongst the tombs of Mycen&aelig; and
Etruria, and those of a later date&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the laces of
gold used to decorate the vestments of the clergy,
and the simple but sumptuous gowns of the Middle
Ages. Along with the stole and maniple of St.
Cuthbert, which are now at Durham Cathedral, was
found a piece of detached gold lace, which must have
formed a separate trimming. St. Cuthbert died in
685 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, and was buried at Lindisfarne, his body
being afterwards transferred to Durham to save it
from the desecration of the Danes who were ravaging
the land. Over the body was a cloth, or sheet, which
was worked in cutworks and fringes, showing that
even at so early a date initial efforts at lace-making
had been attempted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">EARLY ENGLISH SAMPLERS, SHOWING CUT AND DRAWN WORK.
<br />
(<i>S.K.M. Collection.</i>)</span>
</div>

<p>As far as we can gather, the earliest endeavour at
lace-making originated with the drawing of threads
in linen fabrics, then dividing the existing threads into
strands, and working over them, in various fanciful
designs, either with a buttonhole stitch or simply
a wrapping stitch. Exactly this method is used at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span>
the present day, and is known as hem-stitching and
fine-drawing. A later development suggested, apparently,
cutting away of some of the threads, their
place being supplied with others placed angularly or
in circles. Many delightful examples of the work
are to be seen in our Old English samplers of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and even so
recently as thirty years ago specimens of this primitive
and early lace-making were to be seen in the
quaint "smock-frock" of the English farm labourer,
a garment which, though discarded by the wearer
in favour of the shoddy products of the Wakefield
looms, is now deemed worthy of a place in the
collector's museum.</p>

<p>It required little effort of fancy and skill, by the
simple process of evolution and survival of the
fittest, to expand this plan of cutting away threads
and replacing them with others to doing away
<i>entirely</i> with existing and attached threads, and
supplying the whole with a pattern of threads laid
down on some geometric fashion on a backing of
parchment, <i>working over</i> and <i>connecting</i> the patterns
together, and afterwards liberating the entire work
from the parchment, thereby making what was known
at the time as "punto in aria," or working with the
needle-point in the air, literally "<i>out of nothing</i>."</p>

<p>Strange as this may appear, this was the origin,
in the fifteenth century, of the whole wonderful fabric
which afterwards became known as "Point lace,"
which altered and even revolutionised dress, made
life itself beautiful, and supplied the women of Europe
with a livelihood gained in an easy, artistic, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
delightful manner. It also, however, led to ruinous
expenditure in every country, at times requiring
special edicts to restrain its extravagance, and even
the revival of the old Sumptuary laws to repress it.</p>

<p>The earliest known lace, and by far the most
popular with all classes, was "Reticella," which was
the first kind evolved on the "punto in aria" principle.
Until the discovery of an easy and simple way
of decorating the linen ruffs and cuffs of the period
these had been quite plain, as many contemporary
portraits show. Afterwards the fashion of trimming
garments of all descriptions with the pointed wiry
edges of Venice became a mania, and led to imitation
in almost every country of Europe. The convents
turned out an immense quantity, thereby
adding enormously to the incomes of their establishments.
It is assumed that it is to the nuns
of Italy we owe the succeeding elaboration of
Reticella, "Needlepoint," the long, placid hours
spent in the quiet convent gardens, lending themselves
to the refinement and delicacy which this
exquisite fabric made necessary. However this may
be, it is certain that in a few years the rise and
development of Needlepoint lace-making was little
short of phenomenal, and every convent was busy
making it and teaching their poorer lay sisters the
art. Some of the wonderful Old Point of this period
is absolutely finer than the naked eye can see, a
powerful magnifying glass being necessary to discern
how the marvellous "toile" or "gimpe" is made.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span></p>

<p>A little later, but still contemporary with the introduction
of Venetian lace, a Pillow lace was being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span>
made in Flanders, the origin of which is not as yet
discovered. It is possible that the fine flax thread
grown and manufactured there may, at the time of
weaving, have suggested a looser and more ornamental
material, but that remains a matter of conjecture.
There must, however, have been an interchange
of examples, as about this time Pillow-made
lace appeared in Italy, and led to the making of
the Milanese and Genoese varieties, and Needlepoint
motifs appeared amongst the woven network of
Flanders.</p>

<p>Lace, under the name of "Lacis," had been known
in France from the time of Catherine de Medici, who
patronised the manufacturers and used it lavishly.
About 1585 she induced Federico di Vinciolo, a
lace-maker and designer of Venice, to settle in
France, and there the making of Venetian lace was
attempted. A mere slavish imitation of the Venetian
school resulted, and it was not until the age of the
<i>Grande Monarque</i>, Louis XIV., that French lace
rivalled that of Venice.</p>

<p>Colbert, the great French Minister, becoming
alarmed at the enormous sums spent on Italian
lace, determined to put a check to its importation;
and, by forbidding its use, establishing lace
schools near Alen&ccedil;on, and bribing Italian workers
to come over as organisers and teachers, started
the manufacture of lace on an extensive scale, the
beautiful fabrics known as Point d'Alen&ccedil;on, Point
d'Argentan, and Point d'Argentella being the result.
It is frequently said that the last-named lace came
from Genoa or Milan, but most of the present-day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
authorities agree that this is one of the many fairy
tales with which the passing of time has adorned
the history of lace.</p>

<p>The persecution of the Protestants when the
Huguenots fled to England, bringing with them their
arts of silk-weaving and lace-making, led to the
introduction of English lace. Devonshire apparently
received a contingent of laceworkers quite distinct
from those who settled in Buckinghamshire and
Bedfordshire, and from the first stages showed far
finer methods and designs. With the exception of
"Old Honiton," England cannot boast of anything
very fine, and even this is merely a meaningless
meandering of woven tape-like design for the greater
part. The lace of Buckinghamshire ranks, perhaps,
lowest in the scale of lace products, its only merit
being its extreme durability.</p>

<p>The laces of Ireland are of comparatively recent
growth, and though in many instances exquisitely
fine, do not as yet show much originality.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span></p>

<h2>II
<br />
THE ART OF LACE-MAKING</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Needlepoint&mdash;Pillow Laces&mdash;Charts of various R&eacute;seaux&mdash;Technical
Terms.</p></div>


<p>Lace-making naturally falls into two classes&mdash;the
Needlepoint and Pillow varieties. In some laces,
more especially of the Belgian class, there is a <i>mixed</i>
lace, the "toile" or pattern, being worked with the
needle, and the ground, or "r&eacute;seau," made round it
on the pillow and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.</p>

<p>To the first-named class we must assign the
Needlepoint laces of Italy and the exquisite handmade
laces of France. To the latter order belong
the early Macram&eacute; lace, called "Punto a Groppo";
the Genoese and Milanese laces of Italy; Mechlin
and Brussels of Belgium; Valenciennes, Lille, and
Chantilly of France; and the English laces of
Honiton, Buckinghamshire, and Bedfordshire.</p>

<p>Pillow lace may be easily distinguished from
Point lace, as in the former the ground, or r&eacute;seau,
is made of plaited threads. That of Point lace is
composed of threads made by the use of the button<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>hole
stitch only, or, in the case of Alen&ccedil;on point,
the mesh is worked in a special manner. The later
laces, <i>i.e.</i>, those made during the last hundred years,
have frequently a ground of machine lace, and thus,
strictly speaking, are not lace at all, but only embroideries
or appliqu&eacute;s. The machine-made ground
can be distinguished by sense of touch alone. If we
take a piece of hand-made net between the finger
and thumb and slightly roll it, it will gather
in a soft little roll, with the touch almost of floss
silk. The machine-made net is hard, stiff, and
wiry, and remains perceptibly so in this test. Also,
the mesh of machine-made lace is as regular as
though made with a fine machine fret-saw, that of
hand-made lace being of varying sizes, and often
following the pattern of the lace design.</p>

<p>The accompanying diagram illustrates the various
grounds, and will prove an infallible guide in distinguishing
the points of difference between Point
and Pillow lace.</p>

<p>Various special and technical terms are used in
describing the method of making lace. Without
burdening the reader too much, a few special terms
must be explained.</p>

<p><i>Brides</i> (literally "bridges").&mdash;These are the connections
between the various parts of a lace design,
both in Needle-point and Bobbin lace. In the
former, they are made entirely of a strand or two
of thread thrown across, and then buttonholed over,
sometimes with tiny loops on the edges, and in
Venetian lace often having minute stars worked upon
them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span></p>

<p><i>Beading.</i>&mdash;A tiny looped edge used to finish woven
or Pillow-made lace.</p>

<p><i>Bobbins.</i>&mdash;One of the essential parts of a Pillow
worker's outfit. These are small, elongated bobbins
made of ivory, bone, or wood, on which is wound the
lace-maker's thread. Sometimes they have been
made very ornamental with carving and other
decorations, and frequently have "gingles," or a
bunch of coloured beads attached to one end. The
terms "Bobbin lace" and "Bone lace" are derived
from these and are synonymous with "Pillow lace."</p>

<p><i>Cordonnet.</i>&mdash;In most <i>Point</i> laces the design is
outlined with a raised <i>cord</i> either worked over
closely with buttonhole stitches, or made separately
and then stitched down. The Cordonnet is one of
the characteristic features of the raised Venetian
points and the French laces of Alen&ccedil;on or Argentan.</p>

<p><i>Couronnes.</i>&mdash;These are decorations of the Cordonnet
especially noticeable in the raised Venetian laces, in
which sometimes the lace is raised and worked upon
no less than four separate times.</p>

<p><i>Dentel&eacute;.</i>&mdash;Lace designed in scallop-form, chiefly
used for border laces.</p>

<p><i>Fillings.</i>&mdash;This word most easily explains the
ordinary terms of "modes" and "&agrave; jours." The
inner parts of the pattern in Needlepoint and Pillow
lace are filled in with various ornamental stitches,
showing an amazing variety of design. By these
fillings various laces may often be distinguished, as
each factory had its favourite "modes."</p>

<p><i>Grounds.</i>&mdash;There are two varieties of grounds, one
made with Brides, and the other either with Needle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>point
or Pillow network. Other names for these are
"R&eacute;seaux" and "Fonds." The method of making
Needlepoint or woven ground often decides the date
and class of the lace.</p>

<p><i>Guipure.</i>&mdash;Literally a <i>tape lace</i>. The name however
is applied to all Pillow laces having a tape-like
design on them.</p>

<p><i>Picots.</i>&mdash;The little loops used to ornament a plain
bride or tie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span></p>

<p>Needlepoint lace is made with needle and thread
and principally in buttonhole stitches. A traced
parchment pattern is procured, the outline made
with a solitary thread stitched down to the parchment
at frequent intervals. The thread is then
worked over with fine buttonhole stitches; the modes
or fillings have a fine network of threads stretched
across, afterwards being buttonholed into a variety of
designs. The edges are then again worked upon
with loops or picots, and in "Rose Point" tiny
stars or roses are worked on suitable parts of the
design, sometimes the "roses" or "stars" being
three in numbers, one poised upon the other. This
is known as "Point de Neige" the whole surface
of the lace being literally sprinkled with tiny stars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
somewhat representing a fine snowfall. The design
is then connected with fine "brides," these in their
turn being dotted and purled with stars and loops.
Most of this exquisite lace requires a powerful
magnifying-glass to discern the intricacy of the work.</p>

<p>The finest lace of this variety was produced in the
sixteenth century, the designs being bold, handsome,
and purely Renaissance in type. That of the Louis
Quatorze period shows the personal influence of his
reign, frequently having tiny figures worked in the
design. A collar in my possession has the Indian
worshipping the sun (the King's glory was said to
rival that of the sun) repeated in each scallop. This
was a favourite design in the magnificent "Point de
France" which was made during the long reign of
Louis, under the management of Colbert.</p>

<p>It is absolutely certain that the laces known as
Venetian Point originated in Italy. Pattern books
still exist showing how the early Reticella developed
into this magnificent lace. In the National Library at
the South Kensington Museum, may be seen the very
patterns designed by Vinciolo, Vicellio, and Isabella
Parasole. These publications actually came from
Venice, and being reproduced in France, Germany,
Belgium, and England, quickly aroused immense
enthusiasm, and lace-making spread far and wide,
at first all other laces being mere imitations of the
Venetian.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span></p>

<p>The chief varieties of the Venetian laces are known
as Rose Point, Point de Neige, Gros Point de Venise
(often erroneously attributed to Spain and called
Spanish Point), and Point Plat de Venise. A much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
rarer variety is "Venetian point &agrave; r&eacute;seau," which is
the flat point worked round with a Needlepoint
ground or mesh, the network following no proper
order but being simply worked round the pattern and
following its curves.</p>

<p>The chief characteristics of Venetian lace are the
buttonhole Cordonnet, fine or thick according to
the style of lace; the wonderful diversities of the
fillings worked in buttonhole stitches; the elaborate
decoration of the Cordonnet; and the starry effects of
the brides or ties. In the flat Venetian Point there
is no Cordonnet.</p>

<p>These Italian laces were admired and purchased by
all the European countries, and the cities of Venice
and Florence made enormous fortunes. The fashions
of the day led to their extensive use, Marie de Medicis
introducing the Medici collar trimmed with Venetian
points specially to display them. At a little later period
the collar became more falling and the heavier "Gros
point" was used. Men and women alike wore lace-trimmed
garments to an excessive degree, the collar
and cuff trimmings being composed of wide Venetian
lace and the silken scarf worn across the body being
edged with narrower and finer lace.</p>

<p>The principal designs for the Venetian lace of all
periods were scrolls of flowers conventionalised in the
Renaissance taste of the time. The generic name
for all laces of the finest period is "Punto tagliato a
foliami." The laces of this time are now almost
priceless. They are genuine works of art, worked
slowly and patiently under the clear light of the
Italian skies by women who were naturally artistic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
and beauty loving, and who, while working the
shining needle and fairy thread in and out of the
intricacies of the design sang the pretty "Lace
Songs" which may be heard at the Burano Lace
School even now, although 200 or 300 years old.
Many specimens of this exquisite lace are to be
found in the South Kensington Museum, where the
flounce given by Mrs. Bolckow at once explains
the whole scheme of Venetian lace-making.</p>

<p>Such lace is not to be purchased now except at
great price. The piece illustrated, see page <a href="#Page_55">55</a>, was only
1-1/8 yards in length, and was sold for &pound;145 by one of
our leading lacemen. Barely 5 yards of Venetian
lace, only 2 inches wide and <i>in rags</i>, was sold at
Debenham &amp; Storr's in August, 1907, for &pound;60; and
even the smallest collar or a pair of cuffs runs well
into &pound;10.</p>

<p>Even in the days of its manufacture this lace commanded
high prices. In the inventory of Queen
Elizabeth's gowns we find such entries as&mdash;</p>

<p>
"To 1 yard Double Italian Cut-worke, &frac14; yd. wide. 55/4.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">" 3 yds. broad needlework lace of Italy, with purls. 50/- per yd."</span><br />

<br />
THE LACES OF GENOA AND MILAN</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Argentella wrongly called Italian&mdash;Genoese&mdash;Mixed laces&mdash;Milanese&mdash;Macram&eacute;.</p></div>


<p>These are mostly Pillow laces, but fine Point laces
were also manufactured in these towns. In the first-named
town it is said that the lace called "Argentella"
was made, but this is extremely doubtful, most
authorities arguing that it was certainly a French lace
made at the best period.</p>

<p>A very representative lace of Genoa is known as
collar lace, very widely used for the falling collars of
the Vandyke period. It was an exceedingly beautiful
and decorative lace, and almost indestructible. Specimens
of this lace can even now easily be secured at
a fair price. The laces known as "Pillow Guipure"
are somewhat open to question, the authorities at
South Kensington Museum agreeing to differ, and
labelling most of the specimens "Italian or Flemish."
The finer pieces of this type of lace may safely be
described as "Flemish," as the flax-thread grown and
made in Flanders was much finer than that grown in
the Southern Countries.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span></p>

<p>Much of the Genoa lace was worked in what we term
"mixed lace," the design being woven on the pillow,
and the ground and fillings worked in with the needle
either in a network or by brides and picots. A much
inferior kind is made with a woven braid or tape,
the turns of the pattern being made in twisted or
puckered braid, much after the style of the handmade
Point lace made in England some thirty years
ago. This lace was known as "Mezzo Punto," though
the French were discourteous enough to term it
"Point de Canaille," as undoubtedly it was an imitation
of the finer laces made in a loose, poor style.</p>

<p>The lace of Milan is unquestionably the most
beautiful of the Pillow laces of Italy. While resembling
the plaited lace of Genoa, there is more
individuality about it. Much of this fine lace was
worked for church vestments and altar cloths.
Various heraldic devices are frequently introduced,
surrounded with elegant scroll designs, the whole
being filled up with woven r&eacute;seau, the lines of which
are by no means regular, but are made to fill in the
interstices.</p>

<p>Yet another Italian lace is known as</p>

<h3>
<i>Punto a Groppo, or Macram&eacute;</i>.
</h3>

<p>No doubt this was the earliest form of woven lace,
and, indeed, it may claim an origin as early
as the first garments worn by mankind. In the
earliest remains of antiquity a <i>fringe</i> often decorates
the edges of garments, curtains, and floor-covering,
and seems to be a natural and fitting finish to what
would otherwise be a hard, straight line. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
various Assyrian and Egyptian monuments this is
noted again and again.</p>

show simply an elaboration of the knotted fringe,

The work is so well known, owing to its revival
during the last thirty years in a coarse form, that it
needs little description. Its use, even at its best
period, was confined to household use, for which
purpose it seems particularly adapted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span></p>

THE LACES OF FRANCE</h2>

<h3><i>The Needlepoint Laces of France</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Catherine de Medici's collection of "Lacis"&mdash;Establishment
of lace-making by Colbert&mdash;"Point de France"&mdash;"Point
d'Alen&ccedil;on"&mdash;"Point d'Argentan"&mdash;Modern reproduction
of these at Burano, Italy.</p></div>


<p>France in the sixteenth century, as always, led the
van of fashion. Lace appears to have been extensively
used long before its apotheosis at the Court of
Louis le Grand, otherwise Louis XIV. Catherine de
Medici patronised the manufacture of "<i>Lacis</i>," which
was merely darned netting, more or less fine. At
this time "Lacis" and "Cut-worke" were practically
all that was known or used. Bed-hangings, curtains,
and furniture-coverings were covered with alternate
squares of lacis and cutwork. Afterwards the Reticella
laces of Italy were imported and had an immense
vogue, but it was not until the artistically
glorious time of Louis XIV. that an attempt was
made to encourage a manufacture of French laces.</p>

<p>Colbert, the astute Minister of Louis XIV., became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
alarmed at the immense sums of money which went
out of the country to purchase the laces of Venice,
and, by means of bribing the best workers of the
Venetian schools, he induced them to settle at
L'Onray, near Alen&ccedil;on. In 1665 he had so far
succeeded that lace rivalling that of Venice was
being produced. The Venetians became alarmed
in their turn (as, indeed, they had need to be) and
issued an edict, ordering the lace-workers to return
forthwith, or, failing this, the nearest relative would
be imprisoned for life, and steps would be taken to
have the truant lace-worker <i>killed</i>. If, however, he
or she returned, complete forgiveness would be extended,
and work found them <i>for life</i> at handsome
remuneration. History does not tell us the result
of this decree, but it evidently failed to destroy the
lace manufacture of France.</p>

<p>At first the lace manufactured at Alen&ccedil;on received
the name of "Point de France," and was absolutely
indistinguishable from that of Venice. Its magnificence
of design, indeed, may be said to have exceeded
anything before attempted. The introduction
of tiny figures was attributable to the overwhelming
personality of Louis XIV., and was symbolical of his
magnificent sway and far-reaching influence. In the
illustration, page <a href="#Page_55">55</a>, an especially fine specimen of
the lace, Madame de Montespan is seen seated under
the crown, two small Indians are on either side;
a tree bearing flags and trophies completes this
tribute to the genius of the lace-makers and the
splendour of the Court.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span></p>

<p>The name "Point de France" is given to all lace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
made from its commencement by Colbert's direction
until about 1678, when the lace-workers, perhaps
forgetting the traditions of the Venetian school,
developed a style of their own and the work became
more distinctly French, being more delicate,
finer in substance, the patterns clearer and more
defined. The importation also of the finer flax
thread from Flanders brought the more exquisite
Pillow lace of Brussels to the notice of the French
lace-workers. The French, as a nation, have always
been foremost in seizing upon new ideas and adapting
them to their own artistic requirements. In this
instance the result was admirable, and it gave to
the world, not the finest lace, as it was impossible
to surpass the earliest Venetian Point laces, but
certainly the next lace in order of merit, "Point
d'Alen&ccedil;on." The chief characteristic of the lace is
the fine, clear ground, the stiff Cordonnet outlining
the pattern, and the exquisite patterns in the "jours"
or fillings.</p>

<p>The cordonnet of Alen&ccedil;on is the only one which
has horsehair for its foundation. A strand of hair
is carefully stitched down to the edges and is buttonholed
over with the finest thread, and is said, although
giving the lace quite a character of its own, to have
been the cause of much of its destruction, as, in
washing, the hair contracts and curls. It will be
noticed also that the ground is worked in strips,
<i>shortways of the lace of less than an inch in length</i>,
afterwards being stitched together in what is known
as "fine joining." So elaborate was the original Point
d'Alen&ccedil;on that no less than eighteen workers were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
engaged on one single piece. Later the number was
reduced to twelve, when the patterns became less
ornate.</p>

<p>Although the factory of Alen&ccedil;on existed well into
the early nineteenth century, the style of lace
gradually deteriorated, until it is now non-existent!
The lace made during the long reign of Louis XIV.
is considered by far the finest and best, showing both
grandeur of style and pattern and exquisite workmanship.
Under Louis XV. the lace was equally
well made, but the patterns followed the Rococo
designs which were now introduced into all other
decorative work, while in the reign of the ill-fated
Louis XVI. it went completely out of fashion,
Marie Antoinette affecting a much simpler style of
lace. The Revolution finally caused the complete
overthrow of Alen&ccedil;on lace, as of all fine art work in
France. An attempt was made by Napoleon I. to
revive it, but its glories had passed, and the hands of
the workers had lost their cunning, the result being
known as the worst type of lace, stiff and ugly in
design and coarse of execution.</p>


<h3><i>"Point d'Argentan."</i></h3>

<p>This lace is practically the same as Alen&ccedil;on with
a variation of ground, which, to the uninitiated,
appears coarse. A magnifying glass, however, will
speedily dispel this illusion. The ground in itself is
a marvellous piece of work, each of the sides of the
mesh being covered with ten buttonhole stitches.
Very frequently a mixed lace of Alen&ccedil;on and
Argentan is found, the result being very fine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Point d'Argentella.</i></h3>

<p>About this lace most authorities dispute, some
stoutly advocating its claims to be French lace
entirely and others averring that it was made <i>in
imitation</i> of the Point d'Alen&ccedil;on by the Genoese.
Be this as it may, the lace known as Point
d'Argentella is exceptionally fine even amongst
other fine laces, and is noted most specially for
the fine "jours" which form an essential part of the
pattern, every effort apparently being made to give
extra scope for their employment. The specimen
illustrated shows some of these "jours" having the
characteristic mayflower, lozenge, and dotted patterns.</p>

<p>Much modern lace of this type is now made
at Burano, Italy, where the coarse Italian lace
formerly made there has been entirely superseded.
It strongly imitates Alen&ccedil;on and Argentan lace,
but is without the raised cord which is so typical
of these, having the pattern outlined with flat
buttonhole stitches only. By many connoisseurs
this is considered the finest lace of this age, being
far superior to modern Brussels. It is entirely handmade,
which cannot be, unfortunately, averred for
Brussels, as the fine machine-made net, woven from
the exquisitely fine thread manufactured in Flanders
and Belgium, serves as the ground for all Brussels
lace made at the present time, except when special
orders like Royal trousseaux are in hand. The
lace-makers of Burano, it may be added, imitate the
finest Venetian Rose Point, Point de Gaze, Alen&ccedil;on,
ever produced, the prices comparing very favourably
with the old work, though still very costly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a></span></p>

<br />
THE PILLOW LACES OF FRANCE</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Valenciennes, "Vraie" and "Fausse"&mdash;Lille&mdash;Chantilly&mdash;Blonde&mdash;Caen
and Brittany.</p></div>


<h3><i>Valenciennes.</i></h3>

<p>Valenciennes was formerly part of Flanders,
being in the province of Hainault. It became a
French town in 1668 by treaty. Being a Flemish
town, the lace made there was purely Pillow lace,
and in fineness of thread and beauty of design it
rivalled in its early stages some of the fine old
Flemish laces, which are more like ornamental
cambric than anything else.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of Valenciennes lace, known
as "Vraie" and "Fausse." These names are very
misleading, as they merely denote the laces made in
the town itself, or in the outskirts.</p>

<p>Early Valenciennes can only be distinguished
from Flemish laces of the same age by the difference
in the <i>ground</i>. By reference to the little <a href="#Page_39">chart</a>
of lace stitches the distinction will easily be seen,
the Valenciennes being much closer and thicker in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
the plait, and having four threads on each side of
its diamond-shaped mesh. Conventional scrolls and
flowers were used as designs for the toile, the
ground and the pattern being made at the same
time.</p>

<p>This lace is said to have been worked, like that of
Brussels, in dark, damp cellars, the moist atmosphere
being necessary to prevent the tiny thread breaking.
The lace-workers became nearly blind, and quite
useless, long before they reached thirty years of age.</p>

<p>So expensive was the fabric that a pair of ruffles
for a gentleman's coat would sell for 4,000 livres.
Madame du Barri made extravagant use of this
lovely lace. In her wardrobe accounts are mentioned,
in 1771, head-dress, throatlets, fichus, and
ruffles, "all pliss&eacute; de Vraie Valenciennes." The
amount of lace used for a head-dress alone is said
to have cost 2,400 livres.</p>

<p>The "Vraie Valenciennes" was practically indestructible,
earning the nickname of the "Eternal
Valenciennes" from its durability. The well-to-do
bourgeoise used to invest her savings in real lace,
treasuring and wearing it on all best occasions for a
lifetime.</p>

<p>The lace-makers of the town itself were so satisfied
with their own lace that they proudly boasted that if
a length commenced in the town of Valenciennes
were taken and completed <i>by the same worker, and
with the same thread</i>, outside their own damp
atmosphere, the exact point of difference would be
shown in the piece.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span></p>

design than that made later, which, by the way,
many connoisseurs much prefer. The latter type
is of clearer ground and more open design. The
flowers do not follow the large scroll-like pattern
of Flanders, but suggest the detached sprays and
festoons of Alen&ccedil;on and Argentan. In both types
there is no cord outlining either pattern or edge.
All is flat as a piece of fine lawn.</p>


<h3><i>Lille.</i></h3>

<p>By no means a <i>favourite</i> lace at any time, Lille
ranks next in merit as a hand-made lace. The mesh
is clearer and larger than most French or Belgian
laces, being made by the simple twisting of two
threads on four sides. The patterns are simple,
and are outlined with a loose flax thread of silky
appearance. The straight edges which characterise
Old Lille lace certainly did not lend
elegance to it. A large manufacture in black lace
was commenced, and the black silk mantles of the
eighteenth century were lavishly trimmed with it.
It is entirely out of favour at this day, however,
only the finest white variety being sought after.</p>

<p>Lace is still manufactured at Lille, but the patterns
of Mechlin are copied, although the tiny square dots,
one of the distinguishing points of old Lille, are still
used.</p>


<h3><i>Chantilly.</i></h3>

<p>The white laces of Chantilly much resemble Lille,
having the same fine, clear ground and a thick, silky-looking
thread outlining the pattern. A little lace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
school was established by the Duchesse de Rohan
early in the seventeenth century, and for quite a
hundred years white laces were made, and became
popular. Marie Antoinette used this pretty lace
as well as Valenciennes extensively to trim her
favourite lawn dresses and fichus when she and
the ladies of her Court retired to the Petit Trianon
to play at being shepherdesses.</p>

<p>About the middle of the eighteenth century
Chantilly began to produce black silk lace of very
fine quality. This is practically the only black lace
for which there is any market. A Chantilly fan or
a Chantilly shawl will always find purchasers. The
exquisite fineness of its ground, the elegance of its
floral festoons and bouquets, make it a desirable
possession. With the Revolution the manufacture
of real old black Chantilly ceased, and was only
revived with the Empire, when, in addition to
copying the old designs, the manufacture of the
famous <i>blonde</i> laces was commenced.</p>


<h3><i>French Blonde Lace.</i></h3>

<p>At first these filmy silk laces were made in the
natural colour floss silk imported from China, hence
its name "Blonde." Some of the finest specimens are
in this colour. Afterwards, when the art of bleaching
the silk was discovered, it was made in a peculiarly
silvery colour, the loosely woven silk being worked
in patterns on what appears a ground of gossamer.
Black Blonde was afterwards manufactured, the lace
being very different to that of nineteenth-century
manufacture, the mesh being large and open. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
was a favourite lace with the Spaniards for mantillas,
and much prosperity resulted to the little town of
Chantilly. As with all other laces, the introduction
of machinery killed the industry as an art, and the
only Blonde laces now made are by machine, and are
quite inartistic and inelegant. Hand-made Chantilly
in black silk is still manufactured, but it has only
a limited output.</p>

</div>


<h3><i>Other French Laces.</i></h3>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>Lace has been made in many smaller towns in
France, but in no instance has it been of sufficient
artistic merit to have made a name. Caen manufactured
Blonde lace in imitation of Chantilly.
In Normandy the peasant women and girls in the
eighteenth century were specially diligent, and
made praiseworthy imitations of Mechlin, Flemish
guipure laces, and Brussels, and also introduced
the working of gold and silver thread and even
beads, which was much used in churches. Some
really exquisite Blonde lace made in this manner
was produced at Caen, fine pearls were used in the
place of beads, and this lace became extremely
popular in England. The Empress Eug&eacute;nie was
particularly fond of it, and in most of the portraits
of her at the zenith of her beauty she is seen
wearing decorated Blonde lace. It is said that this
lace so soon soiled and spoiled in the making that
only women having specially dry hands could be
employed, and that during the summer months the
lace was worked in the open air, and in the winter in
rooms specially built over cow-houses, so that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
animals' breath might just sufficiently warm the
workers in this smokeless atmosphere. Other towns
engaged in lace-making were Havre, Dieppe (the
latter town making a lace resembling Valenciennes),
Bayeux, which carried on an extensive trade with
the Southern Islands; Mexico and Spain taking an
inferior and heavy Blonde lace for mantillas.</p>

<p>In Bretagne so dear is lace to the heart of the
French peasant woman that every garment is trimmed
with lace, often of her own making; and along with
the provision of a little "dot" for her daughter she
makes pieces of lace for her wedding dress. A
curious custom is noted, that the peasant woman
often wears this treasured garment only twice, once
for her wedding and lastly for her funeral!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span></p>

THE LACES OF FLANDERS</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Early Flemish&mdash;Brussels lace&mdash;Point d'Angleterre&mdash;Cost of
real Flanders flax thread&mdash;Popularity of Brussels lace&mdash;Point
Gaze.</p></div>


<p>Whether Italy or Flanders first invented both
Needlepoint and Pillow laces will ever remain a
moot point. Both countries claim priority, and both
appear to have equal right. Italian Needlepoint
without doubt evolved itself from the old Greek or
Reticella laces, that in turn being a development of
"Cutworke" and drawn thread work. Flanders produces
her paintings by early artists in which the
portraits are adorned with lace as early as the fourteenth
century. An altar-piece by Quentin Matys,
dated 1495, shows a girl making Pillow lace, and
later, in 1581, an old engraving shows another girl
busy with her pillow and bobbins. An early Flemish
poet thus rhapsodises over his countrywomen's
handiworks:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Of many arts, one surpasses all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The threads woven by the strange power of the hand&mdash;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
<span class="i0">Threads, which the dropping of the spider would in vain attempt to imitate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And which Pallas herself would confess she had never known."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Whether Flanders imitated the Italian laces or
not, it is unquestioned that every other lace-making
country imitated <i>her</i>. Germany, Sweden, France,
Russia, and England have, one after the other,
adopted her method to such an extent that, following
the tactics of Venice in 1698, she also issued an edict
threatening punishment to all who would entice her
workers away.</p>

<p>So alike are the early laces of Flanders that it is
impossible to distinguish what is known as Flemish
Point, Brussels Point, and Point d'Angleterre. The
last-named lace is peculiar, inasmuch as it has a
French appellation, is named "English," and yet is
purely Brussels in character. Two stories gather
round this lace, which accounts for its name. One is
that the English Government in the time of Charles
II., seeing so much money go out of the country, forbade
the importation of Brussels lace. The English
lace merchants, not to be done out of their immense
profits, smuggled it over in large quantities, and produced
it as having been made in Devonshire, and
sold it under the name of English Point. Another
legend is that when Colbert, in the reign of
Louis XIV., determined to encourage lace-making
in his own country, made prohibitive the importation
of any other lace than France's own manufacture, the
French Court, which had already become enamoured
of Brussels lace, therefore had it smuggled into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
England and thence to France, as <i>English laces</i>
were at that time too insignificant to come under
Colbert's ban.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>Whichever tale we choose to believe is of little
consequence. It is sufficient to say that fine Point
d'Angleterre is simply Brussels of the best period
when the glorious Renaissance was at its height.
It is absolutely indistinguishable from Brussels of the
same period. The specimen lappet, illustrated, shows
the "figure" motif which appears in "Point de
France" and the old "Venetian Point," and which
at once dates its manufacture.</p>

<p>Practically the term Flanders or Flemish lace can
be applied to all the laces made in Flanders and
Belgium of the earliest periods. It is peculiarly fine;
the specimen shown is as fine as gossamer, showing
a total absence of Cordonnet, of course, and not even
having the loose thread which marks the stems
and leaves of Brussels and Angleterre. The flax of
Flanders was at the time of the great lace industry
known and imported to all the towns engaged in
making it. Italy could procure nothing so fine and
eminently suitable to the delicate work she made her
own as this fine thread, grown in Flanders, and spun
in dark, damp rooms, where only a single ray of light
was allowed to enter. The thread was so fine, it is
said, that it was imperceptible to the naked eye and
was manipulated by touch only. The cost of this
thread was &pound;240 a pound, and one pound could be
made into lace worth &pound;720! Real Flanders lace
thread even now, spun with the help of machinery,
costs &pound;70, and is nothing like so durable as the old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
threads. When we consider that lace to be known
as "Old Lace" must be two hundred or three hundred
years old, we can understand the strength of this
fairy thread, which was like a spider's web in filminess
and yet durable enough to last centuries of wear, and
remain as a lasting memorial of its beauty.</p>


<h3>BRUSSELS</h3>

<p>The early Flemish laces cannot be traced to any
particular town, but Brussels early obtained a reputation
for the production of the soft, elegant laces
which are variously known as "Real old Brussels,"
"Point d'Angleterre," "Point d'Aiguille," and "Point
de Gaze." Almost every woman, although knowing
little about lace as an art, knows and easily recognises
"Brussels." It has ever been the most popular lace,
partly because its price has never been actually prohibitive,
although always costly. Choice pieces of
Old Brussels, with real ground, rank among the laces
of France and Venice as pieces of price, but the
later period, especially the kind known as Brussels
applique, is within everybody's reach, even if only
as a border for a best handkerchief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Lace made at Brussels at all periods has one
characteristic that places it at once and makes
identification easy at a glance. The threads of the
toil&eacute;&mdash;that is, the pattern&mdash;follows the <i>curves</i>, instead
of, as in other Flanders laces, being straight <i>up</i> and
<i>down</i> and <i>across</i>, each thread being exactly at right
angles to the other; Brussels lace also has a distinctive
edge to its pattern. It has no Cordonnet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
but a little set of looped stitches worked along the
edge of the design, afterwards whipped over to keep
the edge in place. This is most clearly seen in every
specimen, and, in conjunction with the curved toil&eacute;,
at once settles the vexed question of the origin of
Point d'Angleterre.</p>

<p>The mesh or ground is, again, quite different to
other laces. It has three varieties of ground&mdash;</p>

<p>1. One, mostly used in Point d'Angleterre, being of
fine "brides" with four or five picots, but this ground
is also seen in Venetian and French laces.</p>

<p>2. A hand-made ground made of looped buttonhole
stitches, which is the finest and most gossamer-like
of all; and</p>

<p>3. A woven ground made on the pillow with plaited
thread, very like Mechlin, but under the magnifying
glass having two longer sides to its hexagonal mesh,
and therefore being more open and clear.</p>

<p>The hand, or rather needlepoint, ground was
three times more expensive than the woven, as it
was stronger and more lasting. The special value of
the "vrai reseau" in our own day is that it can be
imperceptibly repaired, the broken stitches replaced,
whereas in the woven ground the point of junction
must show.</p>

<p>The needle-made net is so fine that one piece in
my possession, though measuring &frac34; yard by 8
inches can easily, in its widest part, be gathered
and passed through a finger ring. At the present day
this net is not made, and even the fine woven ground
is not used except for Royal wedding orders or for
exhibition purposes. A magnificent piece belonging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
to Messrs. Haywards, of New Bond Street (which
cannot be photographed, unfortunately, as it is between
two sheets of glass, and might fall to pieces if
taken out), was made for George IV., and not delivered,
owing no doubt to the usual depleted state of
that monarch's exchequer. Messrs. Haywards (whose
courtesy is as boundless as their reputation) are
always pleased to show this and their other splendid
specimen collections to those interested in old lace.</p>

<p>Perhaps no lace is so diversified in style as
Brussels. At first it was purely Flemish, and
almost indistinguishable from it. Then the Venetian
influence crept in, and elaboration of pattern
and the Renaissance scrolls and flower work showed
itself. At the Louis Quatorze period the introduction
of the "fairy people," seen at its finest and
best in Point de France, marks a time of special
beauty. Afterwards the influence of Alen&ccedil;on was
shown (though it never rivalled the exquisite lace of
this factory), and from that time to the present day
these designs have remained for use in its best
work.</p>

<p>Some of the choicest specimens of old Brussels
are shown in the now discarded "lappets," which
when a lace head-piece and lappets were part of
every gentlewoman's costume, were actually regulated
by Sumptuary Laws as to length. The longer the
lappets the higher the rank.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">{113}</a></span></p>

<p>The great Napoleon, while reviving the lace-making
of Alen&ccedil;on, specially admired fine old
Brussels, and at the birth of his only son, the little
"King of Rome," ordered a christening garment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a></span>
covered with the Napoleonic "N's," crowns and
cherubs. This was sold in 1903 at Christie's for
&pound;120. At the same sale a Court train realised
&pound;140.</p>

<p>In the "Creevy Papers, 1768-1838," mention is
made of Lord Charles Somerset complaining of not
having slept all night, "not having had a minute's
peace through sleeping in 'Cambrik sheets,' the
Brussels lace with which the pillows were trimmed
tickling his face"! This occurred at Wynyards, the
seat of the Earl of Londonderry.</p>

<p>Queen Anne followed the extravagant fashion
of wearing the costliest laces which William III.
and Queen Mary carried to such an excess. In
1710 she paid &pound;151 for 21 yards of fine Brussels
edging, and two years later the account for Brussels
and Mechlin laces amounted to &pound;1,418.</p>

<p>In the succeeding reign the ladies of George I.'s
period wore lappets and flounces, caps, tuckers,
aprons, stomachers, and handkerchiefs, all made of
Brussels.</p>

<p>In the time of George II. lace was even more
worn, but English lace began to rival Brussels, not
in quality, but as a substitute.</p>

<p>George III. and his wife, Queen Charlotte, were
economists of the first order, and personal decoration
was rigidly tabooed; hence the almost total extinction
of lace as an article of apparel, while in George IV.'s
time dress had evolved itself into shimmery silks
and lawns, lace being merely a trimming, and the
enormous head-dress decorated more frequently with
a band of ribbon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span></p>

<p>An exquisite portrait of Louis Philippe's Queen,
Marie Amelia, by the early Victorian painter Winterhalter
(whose paintings are again by the revival of
fashion coming into favour) shows this fine old
<i>grande dame</i> in black velvet dress covered with three
graduated flounces of Brussels lace, cap and lappets
and "tucker" of the same lace, lace fan, and, sad to
relate, a scarf of English machine-made net, worked
with English run embroidery!</p>

<p>Although good Queen Adelaide had a pretty fancy
for lace, she wore little of it, and it was left to Queen
Victoria to revive the glory of wearing Brussels to
any extent; and she, alas! was sufficiently patriotic
to encourage home-made products by wearing almost
exclusively Honiton, which I personally am not good
Englishwoman enough to admire except at its latest
stage (just the past few years), when lace-making,
as almost every other art work in this country, is
emerging from what, from an artistic point of view,
has been one long Slough of Despond.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span></p>

<h2>VIII
<br />
THE MODERN BRUSSELS LACES AND MECHLIN</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Modern Brussels, Point Gaze&mdash;Ghent&mdash;Duchesse Point&mdash;Mechlin
(the Queen of Laces).</p></div>


<p>Magnificent laces are still made at Brussels, but
almost wholly on a machine-made ground, the
workers and merchants apparently finding the old
hand-made ground unprofitable. The machine-made
ground is cheap, and often of mixed flax and
cotton instead of being of purely Flanders flax
thread, as in the old days. Both quality and
colour suffer from this admixture, the lace washing
badly and wearing worse.</p>

<p>The most common lace is the Point Applique, in
which the sprays, groups, and borders on the design
are made separately by hand on the pillow, and are
afterwards applied by tiny stitchings to the machine-made
net. Some qualities are better than others.
In the better class the sprays are appliqued to
the net, which is then cut away and the interstices
of the design filled in with hand-made modes and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
brides, making a very pretty and showy lace. The
best lace made in Brussels now is</p>


<h3><i>Point Gaze</i>,</h3>

<p>in which the finest modern lace is produced. Its chief
characteristics are its superb designs, repeating many
of the fine Renaissance patterns, its clear ground, and
its use of shading in leaves and flowers, which, while
it adds much to the sumptuous effect, is possibly too
naturalistic. This lace is a mixture of hand and
machine lace, the ground being of the best machine
net, the flowers and sprays frequently needle made, the
various fillings being composed of a variety of designs,
and the shading often being produced in the needle-darning
as in modern Ghent and Limerick. Point
de Gaze is costly, but it has the reputation of appearing
"worth its money" to which few other laces of
the present day can aspire.</p>

<p>Other lace-making towns in Belgium and Flanders
are&mdash;</p>


<h3><i>Ghent</i>,</h3>

<p>which produces a fine machine-made net, worked
and embroidered in exact imitation of the earliest
Limerick lace. So <i>real</i> is this imitation that a fine
flounce of 4 yds. 32 in. wide was sold at a London
auction-room a few months ago, as "real old
Limerick," for &pound;60!</p>

<p>Ghent executes vast quantities of hand-made
imitations of Valenciennes, a good and durable lace,
but much more expensive than the machine-made
varieties which flood the shops as "real Val."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps the only other lace worth mentioning
in smaller and later varieties is that known as
"Duchesse point" or "Bruges," which while being a
showy, decorative, and cheap lace, is anything but
satisfactory either in design, manufacture, or wear.
It is largely composed of cotton, is heavy and
cumbrous in design, and after washing becomes
thick and clumsy. It is pillow-made, the flowers
being made on the cushion and afterwards united by
coarse and few brides.</p>

<p>Almost equal in favour with old Brussels lace was</p>


<h3>MECHLIN,</h3>

<p>which was aptly termed "the Queen of Laces." Old
Mechlin was wondrously fine, and transparent. It is
often spoken of as "Point de Malines" which, of
course, is entirely wrong, as it is not Point at all&mdash;being
made entirely, all at one time, or in one piece,
on the pillow. Much of the lace known under the
general name of Flemish Point is really Malines or
Mechlin, the only difference being the fine silvery
thread which runs all through the designs of real
Mechlin. The earliest date of the manufacture of
Mechlin is unknown, but in 1681, it is recorded, that
the people of Malines busied themselves with making
a white lace known as Mechlin. It became a
fashionable lace in England in 1699, Queen Mary
using it considerably and Queen Anne buying it
largely, in one instance purchasing 83 yards of it
for &pound;247.</p>

<p>It has always remained a favourite lace with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
English royalties, Queen Charlotte almost exclusively
using it. The other day I discovered in a bric-&agrave;-brac
shop about twenty yards of it, old and discoloured,
it is true, which came directly from Queen Caroline,
the ill-used wife of George IV. In the earlier
Mechlin, although pillow-made, the introduction of
the "brides with picots," and also the may-flower
patterns of Brussels, helped to make it more decorative.
The ground or r&eacute;seau was very similar to
Brussels hand-made, but the hexagonal mesh is
shorter, as reference to the diagram of r&eacute;seaux
will show.</p>

<p>The exquisite "lightness" of Mechlin, so specially
adapted to "quillings" and "pleatings," accounted for
its popularity. It was specially suitable to the lawns
and muslins of the eighteenth century, but little of
this lace is left owing, no doubt, to its great favour
except the ubiquitous "lappets," for which it was no
doubt "the Queen of Lace."</p>

<p>The immediate cause of its extinction was the
introduction of Blonde laces, and later its final
overthrow came from its being the easiest lace to

<br />
OTHER CONTINENTAL LACES</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Spanish lace; Gold and silver laces of Spain&mdash;German laces&mdash;Russian
laces&mdash;Maltese silk and thread laces.</p></div>


<p>Outside the great lace-making countries of Italy,
France, and Flanders, little lace was ever made, and
that little of less consequence.</p>


<h3><i>Spanish Lace.</i></h3>

<p>Much of the old lace known as "Spanish Point" is
not Spanish at all, but the best of Italian Rose
Point on a large scale, being the variety known as
Gros Point. It was not extensively used for
dress purposes, as contemporary portraits show,
but Spain being such an ultra-Romanist country,
vast quantities of it were imported into Spain for
church use. When Spain fell on unhappy days, in
1830, and the religious houses were dissolved, this
lace was eagerly bought by connoisseurs and collectors
and became known as Spanish Point. It is not unlikely
that the Italian lace was copied by the nuns
of the Spanish convents; indeed, at South Kensington<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>
Museum there is a set of church altar lace which is
admittedly Spanish work and is a distinct but far
off imitation of Italian Point.</p>

<p>Spain made gold and silver laces of fine quality
and gorgeous design. Blonde laces in both cream
and black are almost indigenous to the soil, and a
particular kind of black Blonde, embroidered with
colours, specially appealed to the colour-loving
people.</p>


<h3><i>German Laces.</i></h3>

<p>Perhaps at the present day more lace is made in
Germany than at any other period. An enormous
manufacture of good machine-made lace is exported
yearly, the variety known as Saxony being both
popular and cheap.</p>

<p>Germany has no national lace, the clever <i>hausfraus</i>
caring more to decorate their table and bed-linen
than their persons, and using the substantial
and practical embroideries of the cross-stitch patterns
more than the elegant frailties of lace trimming.
Lacis network darned into patterns has always
been popular here, as also in Denmark, Sweden, and
Norway.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Russia.</i></h3>

<p>The Russian laces need little more than a passing
note. As in Germany, Lacis and Cutworke form
the only hand-made lace known, the people contenting
themselves with these varieties and using
coloured threads to further decorate them. Their
laces may be called merely Russian embroideries.
Peter the Great did much to found a lace school,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a></span>
but only gold laces were made, of a barbaric
character. Recently an attempt has been made to
imitate the Venetian laces, with very fair results, but
the character is very stiff and mechanical, going back
to the primitive forms of Reticella rather than the
elegancies of Italian Point.</p>

<p>The only other Continental lace requiring note is</p>


<h3><i>Maltese</i>,</h3>

<p>a lace made entirely with bobbins and on a
pillow. This lace is of ancient make, being known
as early as the old Greek laces, which it strongly
resembles. Its very popularity has killed its use as
a fine lace, and at the present day it is copied as a
cheap useful lace in France, England, Ireland, and
even India. The old Maltese lace was made of the
finest flax thread, afterwards a silk variety, which is
well known, being made in cream. Black lace was
also manufactured, and at the time of the popularity
of black lace as a dress trimming it was much used.
At the present day the lace is not of the old quality,
cotton being frequently mixed with the flax threads.
There is no demand for it, and it is about the most
unsaleable lace of the day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></span></p>

A SHORT HISTORY OF LACE IN ENGLAND</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Early samplers&mdash;Lace worn by Queen Elizabeth; by the
early Stuarts&mdash;Extravagant use of lace in time of
Charles II.&mdash;William and Mary's lace bill.</p></div>


<p>Even at the risk of being considered utterly unpatriotic,
I cannot give much more than faint praise
to the lace-making of England up to the present
date, when notable efforts are at last being made to
raise the poor imitation of the Continental schools
to something more in accordance with artistic
conception of what a great National Art might
become.</p>

<p>As in all countries, lace-making apparently commenced
in its early English stages by drawn-thread
and cutwork. In many of the charming old sixteenth-century
English samplers just as exquisite
cut-work, and its natural successor Reticella, or
"punto in aria" is shown, as in the finest examples
of the Venetian schools. Unfortunately, however,
English fine lace-making came to a sudden and
inexplicable end, although we know that any quantity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span>
of fine Venetian, exquisite Brussels, or Flemish laces,
and the wonderful Point de France were being imported
into the country and lavishly used.</p>

<p>As early as the reign of Edward IV. lace was mentioned
as being prohibited for importation amongst
other items of feminine luxury, such as "ribans,
fringes of silk and cotton," but it is considered that
the word "laces" here means only the twisted threads
that go to make up a lace or tie, commonly ending
in tags or points. It must be allowed, however,
that laces, or more probably "gimps" of gold and
silver threads were used for trimming both lay and
ecclesiastical garments, and in Henry VII.'s reign
we find that importation of Venetian lace was permitted,
but this is generally admitted still to refer to
gold and silver lace, more probably coming from
Genoa.</p>

<p>It was not really until the time of bluff King Hal
that lace became an article of fashion, when during
the life of the last of his unfortunate queens he
permits "the importation of all manner of gold and
silver fringes, or <i>otherwise</i>, with all new 'gentillesses'
of what facyion or value, for the pleasure of
our dearest wyeff the Queen."</p>

<p>Henry himself also began to indulge in all these
little elegances of fashion, and wore his sleeves
embroidered with cutwork, and handkerchiefs edged
with gold and silver, treating himself liberally to
"coverpanes" and "shaving-cloths" trimmed with
gold lace.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">EDMUND SPENSER: COLLAR TRIMMED WITH RETICELLA.
<br />
Early period.</span>
</div>

<p>Little mention of white work was made in the
inventories of Henry VIII. or his Queens, but Cardinal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
Wolsey seems to have had more than his share
of cutwork embroideries, judging from contemporary
portraits.</p>

<p>In Queen Mary's reign white work began to
be more frequently spoken of, and in 1556 it is
stated that Lady Jane Seymour presented the
Queen with "a smock of fair white work, Flanders
making."</p>

<p>It was not until Queen Elizabeth's time that
lace became freely mentioned; then suddenly we
are introduced to an endless variety of lace and
trimmings, both of gold and silver, pearl and embroideries,
and various white work! In some of the
old Chronicles mention was made of drawn work,
cut-work, Crown lace, bone lace for ruffs, Spanish
chain, parchment, hollow, and diamond lace. Many
of these terms cannot be understood.</p>

<p>The enormous ruffs worn by Queen Elizabeth
were introduced into England in the time of her
sister Mary. Portraits both of Philip of Spain and
Queen Mary show ruffs, but not edged with lace.
Queen Elizabeth's, on the contrary, are both edged
with lace and, in some instances, covered with it.
On her poor old effigy at Westminster Abbey, where
her waxen image is dressed in her actual garments,
the only lace that appears is on the enormous ruff,
three-quarters of a yard wide, covered with a fine
lace of the loose network kind. The rest of her
garments are trimmed with gold and silver lace and
<i>passementerie</i>.</p>

<p>In the succeeding reign lace of a geometric design
shows itself on the ruffs of the richest people.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
Pictures in the National Portrait Gallery show many
exquisite examples of the beautiful Reticella of
Venice, which must have been very costly to the
purchaser, as twenty-five yards or more of this fine
lace were required to edge a ruff.</p>

<p>It was in the reign of James I. and his consort,
Anne of Denmark, that Flanders lace and the
expensive Point laces of Italy first became widely
popular. Then, as now, they were costly&mdash;to such
an extent that many gentlemen sold an estate to
buy laces for their adornment.</p>

<p>It was during this reign that we first learn of a
lace being made in England, as Queen Anne of
Denmark on her journey south purchased lace at
<i>Winchester</i> and <i>Basing</i>, but history mentions not
what kind of lace it was. Apparently only a simple
kind of edging was used, made on a pillow.</p>

<p>The enormous ruffs went out of fashion with the
death of James I. Charles I., in all his portraits,
wears the falling collar edged with Vandyke lace.
It was during this reign that Venetian lace reached
its apotheosis in England. The dress of the day
has never been surpassed, though it became much
more elaborate and ostentatious in the time of
Charles II. and William and Mary. Falling collars
were specially adapted to the display of the handsome
laces of Venice. The cuffs of the sleeves
were likewise trimmed with the same; scarves were
worn across the breast, trimmed with the narrower
Reticella.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>During the Commonwealth the laces of Venice
suffered a temporary eclipse, and the plainer laces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a></span>
of Flanders were freely used. Cromwell himself, it
is said, did not disdain the use of it. His effigy at
Westminster was dressed in a fine Holland lace-trimmed
shirt, with bands and cuffs of the same.
This effigy, by the way, was destroyed at the
Restoration.</p>

<p>Charles II., who during his exile in France had
become imbued with the extravagant taste of the
French Court, gave vast orders for "Points of
Venice and Flanders," on the plea of providing
English lace-workers with better patterns and
ideas.</p>

<p>The falling collar certainly went out of fashion,
but lace was liberally used on other parts of the
dress. Lace frills of costly Point edged the knee-breeches,
lace cravats were worn and deep falling
cuffs. Charles II., in the last year of his reign,
spent &pound;20 for a new cravat for his brother's birthday.</p>

<p>During James II.'s reign extravagance in lace
purchases are still mentioned, but it surely reached
its culmination in the joint reign of William and
Mary, when enormous sums were spent by both
King and Queen. In one year Queen Mary's lace
bill amounted to &pound;1,918. New methods of using
lace were fashioned. A huge head-dress called the
"Fontange," with upright standing ends of Venetian
Point, double hanging ruffles falling from elbow
sleeves, lace-trimmed aprons, lace tuckers, characterised
the feminine dress of the day, while the
"Steinkirk" cravat and falling cuffs of William III.'s
day ran up accounts not much less than that of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
Queen. In 1690 his bill was &pound;1,603, and in 1695
it amounted to &pound;2,459!</p>

<p>The effigies of William and Mary in the Abbey,
wear the very finest Venetian Point laces. None of
the other figures wear such costly lace, nor in such
profusion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span></p>

ENGLISH LACES</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Queen Anne and Mechlin&mdash;Establishment of lace-making in
Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire&mdash;Buckingham lace&mdash;Wiltshire
lace&mdash;Devonshire lace&mdash;Modern Honiton
revival.</p></div>


<p>It was in Queen Anne's time that the earliest really
good lace manufactured in England appeared. Driven
from France by the edict of Louis XIV., the refugees
found a home in England, and encouraged by Queen
Anne's fondness for laces other than Venetian, they
made and taught the English lace-workers, among
whom they settled, the art of real lace-making,
which up to this time had apparently been
only half understood. Numerous lace schools now
sprang up, the counties of Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire,
and Northampton specially becoming
known. Valenciennes and Mechlin were the varieties
of laces principally copied; a very pretty lace, very
reminiscent of Mechlin, being the "Baby lace," which
received its name from being so much used to trim
babies' caps. Although very much like Valenciennes
and Mechlin, the laces were much coarser both in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
thread and design than their prototypes. Bedfordshire
and Northamptonshire did not long retain the art of
lace-making, but Buckingham lace remained a staple
manufacture, and is much esteemed even to-day,
many connoisseurs considering it far better as a lace
than the somewhat clumsy laces of Devonshire. The
specimen shown is a piece of old Buckingham lace
closely copying the r&eacute;seau and sprigs of Lille which
most lace-lovers consider it excels. The net of
Buckinghamshire is an exact copy of the Lille mesh,
being made of two threads twisted in a diamond
pattern, the sprays being worked on the pillow at
the same time. The patterns of the old Buckingham
lace are not very varied, the best known being
what is called "Spider lace," a coarse kind of
open mesh being worked in the pattern. The
principal town engaged in the eighteenth century
was Newport Pagnel, which was cited as being most
noted for making Bobbin lace. Old Brussels designs
were used, and some quaint lace of early Flemish
design, was made. The early English run
lace, which was even so late as fifty years ago
very popular, was mostly made here. Aylesbury,
Buckingham, and High Wycombe also made
lace, and in the last-named old town cottage lace-making
may be seen to this day. Very quaint
are the old lace bobbins that may be purchased
in the "antique" shops of these lace-making towns.
The lace-workers apparently indulged many a
pretty fancy in shaping them in a diversity of
ways, very few bobbins being alike. Some were
made of bone, really prettily turned, with dotted
and pierced patterns on them. Others were silver-studded,
and again others were banded in silver.
The wooden ones were always decorated, if possible,
each one differently from the others, so that
the worker might distinguish each thread without
looking at it. Nearly every bobbin was ended with
a bunch of coloured beads strung on wire, and a
collection of these bobbins, with their "gingles,"
often yields up a pretty and quaint necklace.
One in my possession has a quaint bead made
of "ancient Roman glass," worth at least ten
shillings. One wonders how this bit of Roman
magnificence had strayed into an English cottage
home!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>Buckinghamshire is the only one of the Midland
counties which has produced <i>wide</i> lace; the
adjoining counties confined themselves to edgings
at most some 6 inches wide. A flounce in my
collection measures 21 inches, and is of very
elegant design, and of fine quality. In Wiltshire
lace appears to have been made at an early date
in the eighteenth century, but little lace is left
to show its quality. A curious piece is said to
belong to an old family in Dorset, who vouch for
the lace having belonged to Queen Charlotte, the
wife of George III. Like many other traditional
"antiques," this is undoubtedly a fairy story, as it
claims to have been made in commemoration of
the defeat of the Spanish Armada, <i>at contemporary
times</i>. It is exceedingly handsome, showing
one of Philip's ships, very suggestively surrounded
by big sea fish and apparently resting on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span>
rocky bottom of the ocean. In the next panel
Tilbury Fort is portrayed, and another ship, one
of England's glory, proudly rules the waves. The
design is undoubtedly English, and most probably
it was made in commemoration of the historic event&mdash;but
the lace is Point d'Argentan, and was most
likely manufactured specially for Queen Charlotte.</p>

<p>Lyme Regis at one time rivalled Honiton, the
laces of both towns being equally prized. Queen
Charlotte wore a "head and lappets" made here
when she first came to England, and afterwards
she ordered a splendid lace dress to be made.
When, however, Queen Victoria, in her wish to
encourage the English makers, sent an order for
her marriage lace, not sufficient workers were found
to produce it.</p>


<h3>DEVONSHIRE LACE.</h3>

<p>As early as 1614 the lace-makers of Devonshire
were known. The influx of refugees from Flanders
in the Midlands and southern counties undoubtedly
established lace-making in both parts of the kingdom.
Many of the Honiton lace-workers married
these refugees, and to this day the people are of
mixed descent. Quaint names of Flemish extraction
appear over the shop doors.</p>

<p>In the early days both men, women, and children
seem to have pursued the art of lace-making, boys
learning and working at it until the age of sixteen,
when they were either apprenticed to some trade
or went to sea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">{163}</a></span></p>

<p>Most of the old Devonshire laces bear distinct
likeness to the fine Flemish lace, only the clumsiness
of the design or the coarse workmanship differentiating
them. It has, however, one special feature
which gave it the name "Trolly lace," as, unlike the
perfectly flat lace of Flanders, it has a coarse thread
or "trolly" outlining its patterns, and being made
of English thread, it was coarse and not very durable.</p>


<h3><i>Honiton</i></h3>

<p>has always easily ranked first amongst our British
laces, although by many not considered equal to fine
Bucks. Like the Midland lace, it has been always
made with Flanders thread, and therefore has maintained
its popularity because of its <i>wear</i> and its <i>colour</i>.
The early Honiton workers copied "Brussels" lace,
but because of their inability to produce an artistic
design it has never been anything but a <i>poor</i> copy.
Even when the Brussels influence was most direct
the flowers and sprays were placed inartistically,
while the scroll copies of the early Flemish schools
can only be termed the imitative handiwork of a
child.</p>

<p>The most prized specimens of old Honiton are
those with hand-made ground, made of Flanders
flax. Very little of this real ground Honiton
lace is left. Queen Victoria did much to make
Honiton lace <i>the</i> lace of the land; but although
a regular trade has been established, and much
good work accomplished, Honiton of the past will
never be regarded on the same plane as the laces
of Venice, France, and Brussels. Even in its best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">{166}</a></span>
variety it lacks the exquisite filmy touch of Brussels,
the dainty grace of Alen&ccedil;on, and the magnificence of
Point de France and Venetian Point. The Honiton
laces made since the introduction of machine-made
net is especially poor. Flower sprigs and sprays
are made separately on the pillow, and afterwards
applied to the machine-made ground. These are, as a
rule, flowers and foliage treated naturalistically, and
are heavy and close in design. These are often
very sparingly applied over a wide expanse of net in
order to make as much lace with as little trouble as
possible. This is very different to the work of the
old Honiton lace-worker, who made every inch of it
herself&mdash;first the sprays and scrolls, then worked the
ground round it, and received, it is said, from the
middleman (who purchased it for the town market)
as many shillings as would cover the lace offered
for sale.</p>

<p>We are glad to say, however, that very praiseworthy
efforts are being made to introduce better
methods and more artistic designs in the many lace
schools which are being formed in various parts of
Devon. Mrs. Fowler, of Honiton, one of the oldest
lace-makers in this centre, making exquisite lace,
the technique leaving nothing to be desired, and
also showing praiseworthy effort in shaking off the
trammels of the traditional designs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></span></p>

<p>Scotch lace can hardly be said to exist. At one
time a coarse kind of network lace called "Hamilton
lace" was made, and considerable money was obtained
by it, but it never had a fashion, and deservedly so.
Since the introduction of machinery, however, there
has been considerable trade, and a tambour lace is
made for flounces, scarfs, &amp;c. The more artistic class
of work made by Scotswomen is that of embroidering
fine muslin, and some really exquisite work is made
by the common people in their homes.</p>

remembered that she married firstly the Dauphin of
France, and while at the French Court imbibed the
taste for elegant apparel and costly lace trimmings.
There is no record that she ever wore lace of her own
country's manufacture, and, although English writers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
often quote the lace made by her fair hands, really
the needlework made by Queen Mary at Fotheringay
was embroidery.</p>


<h3><i>Irish Laces.</i></h3>

<p>The early lace of Ireland was the usual cut and
drawn work, and it was not until the earlier part of
the nineteenth century that lace-making actually
became a craft. In the eighteenth century many
brave attempts were made to commence lace schools,
and the best work was done in the convents, where
really fine work was executed by the nuns, the
patterns having been sent from Italy. It was not
until 1829 that the manufacture of Limerick lace was
first instituted. This really is not lace at all, as it is
merely chain-stitch worked in patterns on machine-made
net.</p>

<p>This pretty so-called lace was first made at
Limerick by an Oxford man, who established a
school there, taking with him twenty-four girls as
teachers. It quickly became very popular, in the
early "fifties" every woman of either high or low
degree possessing herself of at least a lace collar
or fichu of Limerick lace.</p>

<p>In 1855 more than 1,500 workers were employed,
but decidedly the best lace of the manufacture belongs
to the time prior to this date. The quality of the
net ground has also deteriorated, or perhaps the best
net has not been purchased.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">LIMERICK &quot;FILLINGS.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Very dainty little sprays and flowers are produced
in the fine chain or tambour stitch, the hearts of the
flowers or the centres of the scallops being worked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a></span>
over in an endless variety of extra stitches, as will be
seen in the illustration.</p>

<p>Another variety of lace is Carrick-ma-cross, which
was contemporary with Limerick. This is merely
embroidery again, but has more claim to the title of
lace, as the tiny little flowers and scrolls are connected
with brides made of buttonhole stitch ornamented
with picots. This is really a very handsome
lace, its only drawback being that it will not <i>wash</i>.
The fine lawn of which it is made is buttonholed
round and then cut away. This, in cleaning or
washing, <i>contracts</i> and leaves the buttonhole edging,
and in a few cleanings it is a mass of unmendable
rags.</p>

<p>Slightly more serviceable is another variety of
Carrick-ma-cross, on which the lawn is appliqu&eacute;d to a
machine-made net, the pattern outlined with buttonhole
stitches, and the surplus lawn cut away, leaving
the network as a grounding, various pretty stitchings
filling up the necessary spaces.</p>

<p>Yet another kind of lace is made, and is really
the only real lace that Ireland can claim. This is the
Irish crotchet, which in its finer varieties is a close
imitation of Venetian Point, but made with fine
thread and with a crotchet needle. Some of the
best is really worth purchasing, but it is costly,
realising as much as five guineas per yard. A very
delicate "Tatting" also comes from the Emerald Isle,
and in comparing English and Irish laces one is inevitably
struck with the reflection that there is more
"artistry" in the production of Irish laces and embroidery
than in England with all her advantages.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">{176}</a></span>
The temperamental differences of the two races are
distinctly shown in this, perhaps more than any
other art.</p>

<p>Much really notable work is now being executed
in the Irish lace schools. At Youghal, co. Monaghan,
an exact replica of old Venetian Point is being
worked. Various fine specimens from the school
occupy a place at South Kensington Museum, and
the lace industry of Ireland may be said to be in a
healthy condition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">{177}</a></span></p>

<h2>XIII
<br />
HOW TO IDENTIFY LACE</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Style&mdash;Historical data&mdash;R&eacute;seaux.</p></div>


<p>The great difficulty in attempting to identify any
specimen of lace is that from time to time each
country experimented in the manners and styles
of other lace-making nations. The early Reticella
workers copied what is known as the "Greek
laces," which were found in the islands of the
Grecian Archipelago. Specimens of these laces
found in the excavations of the last thirty years
show practically no difference in method and style.
France copied the Venetian laces, and at one period
it is impossible to say whether a given specimen
was made at Alen&ccedil;on or Venice. Italy, in turn,
imitated the Flemish laces&mdash;to such an extent that
even the authorities at South Kensington Museum,
with all their leisure and opportunities for study
and the magnificent specimens at hand for identification,
admit that certain laces are either "Italian or
Flemish." Valenciennes was once a Flemish town,
and though now French, preserves the Flemish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
character of lace, some specimens of Mechlin being
so like Valenciennes as to baffle certainty.</p>

<p>Later, Brussels borrowed the hand-made grounds
of France and Venice, and still later England copied
Brussels, the guipures of Flanders, and the ground
and style of Lille! All this makes the initial stages
of the study of lace almost a hopeless quest. The
various expensive volumes on lace, although splendidly
written and gorgeously illustrated, leave the student
with little more than an interesting and historical
knowledge on which to base the actual study of lace.
Here I may refer my readers to the one and only
public collection of lace, I believe, in England&mdash;that
of the South Kensington Museum, where specimens
of lace from all countries and of all periods are shown,
and where many magnificent bequests, that of Mrs.
Bolckow especially, make the actual study of lace
a possibility.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that the governing body of
the museum will, in its own good time, make
this a pleasure instead of a pain. The specimens,
the <i>most important to the student</i>, are placed in a
low, dark corridor. Not a glimmer of light can
be obtained on some of the cases, which also are
upright, and placed so closely together that on
attempting to see the topmost specimen on one side
the unfortunate student literally bangs her head into
the glass of the next one. A gentle complaint at the
Directors' office concerning the difficulty brought
forth the astonishing information that there was
no room at their disposal, but that in good time
better light might be found. As these cases have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
been in identically the same place for the past fifteen
years, one hopes that the "good time" may come
before one becomes a "spectacled pantaloon" with
no desire to see the wonders of that Palace of Art.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>This little protest is made in the hope that the
"Lords of the Committee" may possibly have their
attention drawn to what amongst the lace-lovers
and students in this country is a "standing grievance."</p>

<p>It is almost impossible, even from the best of
photographic illustrations, to learn all the intricacies
of identification. The photographs clearly show
style, but it needs specimens of the actual lace
to show method of working. From the illustrations
in this book, specially selected from the South
Kensington Collection, and from specimens in my
own collection, every variety of style may be
easily understood, as they have been particularly
selected to show each point of difference. Commencing
with the earliest form of lacework&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
"cutworke"&mdash;nothing will better show this than
the "Sampler" specimen, which, half way down,
shows two rows entirely typical of this kind of
early lace-making&mdash;for such it is. A little lower,
examples of drawn threadwork are seen, while
the upper portion illustrates satin stitch patterns,
which more properly belong to embroidery.</p>

<p>The ancient collar from the South Kensington
Collection, page <a href="#Page_149">149</a>, shows some of the finest
developments of cutwork, when the foundation of
linen was entirely dispensed with. The work is
exceedingly fine, the threads being no coarser, indeed
in many cases less so, than the fine linen it adorns.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">{188}</a></span>
This is known as Reticella, or "punto in aria."
The last name is applicable to all the laces of Venice
which succeeded Reticella, and means lace literally
made out of nothing or without any building
foundation.</p>

<p>The specimen is still of the same class, but
where before the design was simple geometric
square and pointed as in all the early lace, it now
takes on the lovely flowing scroll of the Renaissance
that marks the latter half of the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>The same grand styles may be noted all through
the great period of Italian Needlepoint lace. It will
be seen in a lesser degree in the Guipure laces of
Milan and Genoa, but here the cramping influence
of the Flemish school shows itself distinctly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>The same bold lines may be noted in the early
Needlepoint lace of France, which had not then
become sufficiently sure of her capacity to develop
a style of her own, and all show the Renaissance
spirit. Afterwards when the superb Point de
France was at its height of manufacture along with
grand outline and exquisite handicraft, the influence
of the mighty monarch Louis XIV. asserted itself
and although the lace itself commands unbounded
admiration, fantastic little notions, symbolical and
naturalistic, showed itself&mdash;as an illustration page
<a href="#Page_75">75</a>: little figures representing "the Indian," "canopied
crown over a sealed lady," trees growing all
manner of bizarre fruit and flowers, all symbolical of
Louis the Magnificent's unbounded power and sway.
In the South Kensington Museum there is a still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a></span>
finer specimen, which has not yet been photographed,
I believe&mdash;a magnificent flounce, about eighteen
inches wide (really two boot top pieces joined), of
what is known as pseudo-Oriental character, which
shows amongst the usual exquisite scrolling no less
than seven different figures on each piece&mdash;viz., an
Indian, a violinist in dress of Louis XIV. period,
a lady riding on a bird, two other ladies, one with
a pet dog and the other a parrot, a lady violinist, and
another lady seated before a toilet-table. These little
figures are not more than three-quarters of an inch
high, but are worked with such minuteness that even
the tiny features are shown. This fantastic adoption
of the human figure was copied in Italy and Flanders.
The finest specimens of Point d'Angleterre (Brussels)
show the same designs; and it may broadly be
stated that all lace with figures is of the Louis XIV.
period, and over two hundred years old.</p>

<p>Succeeding this period came the dainty elegance of
the French laces, when the workers of Alen&ccedil;on and
Argentan had developed a purely French style. Note
the Point d'Alen&ccedil;on, illustration page <a href="#Page_83">83</a>, where the
characteristics of the period are fully shown. The
illustration shows a mixed lace, which only recently has
been acknowledged by the South Kensington people
as Point d'Argentan. Along with the typical Argentan
ground of the upper portion is the fine Alen&ccedil;on
mesh and varied jours of the border. This also
is Louis XIV. style. The lappet shown next is
exceedingly instructive, as till quite lately the people
who professed to understand lace agreed to call
this Genoese, although it was quite unlike anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
else made there. This lappet was so labelled at
South Kensington, but now is admittedly Argentella
(or little Argentan). It is remarkably like Alen&ccedil;on,
being of the same period, the only points of difference
being that the design is not outlined with a raised
Cordonnet (though in different places of the design
a raised and purled Cordonnet is often stitched on
it) and the special ground (partridge eye) which
is agreed to denote "Argentella" lace&mdash;page <a href="#Page_83">83</a>.
It is sometimes called the may-flower ground, but
this is somewhat misleading as that design occurs
in other laces. The only other great style is that
of Flanders, which at its earliest period had received
no influence from the Renaissance that had seized
the southern countries of Europe and was still in
the grip of medi&aelig;val art. It was not until Italian
influence permeated France that Flemish lace perceptibly
altered in character.</p>

<p>These are to all intents and purposes the three
great styles of lace. England had no style: she
copied Flemish, Brussels, and Mechlin laces. Ireland,
on the contrary, copied Italian in her Irish
crotchet and Carrick-ma-cross (in style only, but
not workmanship), and adapted Lille and Mechlin
and Brussels and Buckingham in her Limerick
lace.</p>

<p>The student must next make herself familiar with
the methods pursued by the old lace-workers, and
here the difficulty commences. All lace is either
Needlepoint, pillow-made, or machine-made. <i>Needlepoint</i>
explains itself. Every thread of it is made
with a needle on a parchment pattern, and only two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
stitches are used, buttonhole and a double-loop
which is really a buttonhole stitch.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>This can be clearly understood by referring to
Charts Nos. <a href="#Page_36">I.</a> and <a href="#Page_39">II.</a>, where the <i>two Brussels
grounds</i> are shown. The Needlepoint ground, No. <a href="#Page_36">I.</a>,
is formed by a buttonhole stitch, which loops over
again before taking the next. The pillow-made
ground, No. <a href="#Page_39">II.</a>, shows the threads plaited or twisted
together to form a hexagonal or a diamond-shaped
network. This is all the difference between needle-made
and pillow-made lace, and in itself helps to
identify in many instances its country and period
when it was produced. All the early Italian laces
were Needlepoint, and all the early French laces
were the same. All the Flemish laces (including
Brussels) were pillow-made, and mixed laces in any
of these countries are of later make. Italy adapted
the Flemish pillow-lace, and produced Genoese
and Milanese guipures, in addition to the coarse
imitation of Reticella which she now made by
plaiting threads on the pillow. Brussels adopted
the needle-made motifs and grounds of Italy, and
produced perhaps her finest lace, weaving her beautiful
designs and outlines on the pillow, and afterwards
filling the spaces with needle-made jours and brides,
as in Point d'Angleterre.</p>

<p>A study of Chart <a href="#Page_39">II.</a> will show the different style
of grounds or r&eacute;seaux of both Needlepoint and pillow-made
lace, the buttonhole grounds being either of
"brides" with or without picots, or buttonhole
loops, as in Brussels, and Alen&ccedil;on (with a straight
thread whipping across to strengthen the ground),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
loops buttonholed over all as in Argentan, or made
of tiny worked hexagons with separate buttonholed
threads around them as in Argentella. The pillow-made
grounds are made of two plaited or twisted
threads, except in the case of Valenciennes, when
it is made of four threads throughout (hence its
durability). In Brussels, it will be noted, the threads
are twisted twice to commence the mesh. These
meet two other threads, and are plaited four times,
dividing into two again, and performing the same
twist, the whole making a hexagon rather longer
than round. Mechlin has precisely the same ground,
only that the threads are plaited <i>twice</i> instead of four
times, as in Brussels, making the hexagon roundish
instead of long.</p>

<p>The ground of Lille lace is of exactly the same
shape as Valenciennes, but is composed of two
threads twisted loosely twice each side of the
diamond, and that of Valenciennes being made of
four threads plaited.</p>

<p>With the aid of these little charts, a remembrance
of the various styles and a few actual specimens of
lace, and <i>a powerful magnifying glass</i>, it is not beyond
the power of any reader of this little book to become
expert in the identification of old lace.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span></p>

<p>Lace is such an article of luxury, and, as a rule,
only belonging to the wealthiest class, that it seldom
or ever comes into the open market. In 1907 two
collections were dispersed at Christie's&mdash;those of
Mrs. Massey-Mainwaring and Mrs. Lewis Hill.</p>

<p>The most costly laces are the Venetian Points,
some of the fine Rose Points being priceless. It is
so fragile that little of it remains, and the smallest
piece is eagerly snapped up by collectors.</p>

<p>The famous collection of the late Mrs. Hailstone

been known as a lace collector, and the sale of her
effects was eagerly anticipated. The result was extremely
interesting to the collectors, as Mrs. Hailstone
had collected specimen lengths of almost every
known lace. No huge prices obtained, but the sale
may be regarded as representative, and the prices
quoted as being open-market value.</p>

<p>In December, 1910, probably the most valuable
collection ever placed upon the market was dispersed
at Messrs. Christie's. The late Sir William Abdy
Bt., had for many years devoted his time and money
to the collection of valuable lace, such as now can
only be seen in the great national collections. The
prices obtained are significant of the huge sums
which must be paid to obtain wearable pieces of
valuable lace such as skirt lengths, 3-&nbsp;or 4-yard
lengths of deep flouncings, shawls, coverlets, aprons, &amp;c.</p>

OLD ENGLISH EMBROIDERY</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Needlework pioneer art&mdash;Neolithic remains&mdash;Earliest known
English specimens&mdash;Bayeux tapestry.</p></div>


<p>While the subject of lace-making has been treated
as almost cosmopolitan, that of embroidery, in this
volume, must be regarded as purely national! I
purposely refrain from introducing the embroideries
of other countries, other than mentioning the ancient
civilisations which shared the initial attempts to
decorate garments, hangings, &amp;c. (of which we really
know very little), and shall confine myself to the
needlework of this country, more especially as it is
the one art and craft of which England may be
unfeignedly proud. It is assumed that needlecraft
was the pioneer art of the whole world, that the early
attempts to decorate textiles by embroideries of
coloured silks, and the elaborate use of gold and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
silver threadwork, first suggested painting, sculpture,
and goldsmith's work. Certainly early Egyptian
paintings imitated embroideries, and we have good
ground for supposing that stained glass was a direct
copy of the old ecclesiastical figures or ancient
church vestments. The Neolithic remains found in
Britain show that at a very early period the art of
making linen-cloth was understood. Fragments of
cloth, both of linen and wool, have been discovered in
a British barrow in Yorkshire, and early bone needles
found at different parts of the country are plentiful in
our museums. There is no doubt that we owe much
of our civilisation to the visit of the Ph&oelig;nicians, those
strange people, who appear to have carried all the
arts and crafts of ancient Babylon and Assyria to
the wonder isles of the Greek Archipelago, to Egypt,
to Southern Spain, and to Cornwall and Devonshire.
These people, dwelling on the maritime border of
Palestine, were the great traders of their age, and
while coming to this country (then in a state of
wildest barbarism) for tin left in exchange a knowledge
of the arts and appliances of civilisation
hitherto not understood. The Roman Invasion
(45 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) brought not only knowledge of craftsmanship
but also Christianity. St. Augustine, to whom the
conversion of the Britains is credited, carried with him
a banner embroidered with the image of Christ. After
the Romans had left the country, and it had become
invaded by the Celts and the Danes, and had again
been taken possession of by the Saxons, a period of
not only rest but advancement arrived, and we see
early in the seventh century the country prosperous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
and settled. Aldhelm, Bishop of Sherborne, wrote a
poem in which he speaks of the tapestry-weaving and
the embroidery which the women of England occupied
their lives.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>The earliest specimen of embroidery known to
have been executed in England is that of the stole
and maniple of St. Cuthbert, which is now
treasured at Durham Cathedral. These were worked
by Aelfled, the Queen of Edward the Elder, Alfred
the Great's son. She worked them for Bishop
Fridhestan in 905 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> Her son Athelstan, after her
death, visited the shrine of St. Cuthbert, at Chester-le-street,
and in an inventory of the rich gifts which
he left there, there is recorded "one stole with a
maniple," amongst other articles. These very
embroideries were removed from the actual body of
St. Cuthbert in 1827. They are described by an eyewitness
as being "of woven gold, with spaces left
vacant for needlework embroideries." Exquisitely
embroidered figures are in niches or clouds. The
whole effect is described as being that of a fine
illuminated MS. of the ninth century, and indescribably
beautiful. Another great prelate, St.
Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury, designed
embroideries for the execution of pious ladies of
his diocese (924 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>).</p>

<p>Emma, Queen of Ethelred the Unready, and afterwards
of Canute, designed and embroidered many
church vestments and altar-cloths, and Editha, wife
of Edward the Confessor, embroidered the King's
coronation mantle.</p>

<p>The great and monumental Bayeux tapestry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>&mdash;which
is miscalled, as it is <i>embroidery</i>&mdash;was the work
of Queen Matilda, who, like Penelope, wove the
mighty deeds of her husband and king in an immense
embroidery. This piece of needlecraft comes
upon us as a shock, rather than an admiration, after
the exquisite embroideries worked by and for the
Church. It is interesting, however, as a valuable
historic "document," showing the manners and
customs of the time. The canvas is 227 feet long
and 20 inches wide, and shows events of English
history from the accession of Edward the Confessor
to the defeat of Harold, at Hastings. It is extremely
crude; no attempt is made at shading, the figures
being worked in flat stitch in coloured wools, on
linen canvas. Certainly it is one of the quaintest
and most primitive attempts of working pictures by
needlecraft.</p>

<p>The evidence of the costumes, the armour, &amp;c., are
supposed to tell us that this tapestry was worked many
years after the Conquest, but it can be traced by
documentary evidence as having been seen in Bayeux
Cathedral as far back as 1476. In the time of
Napoleon I. it was removed from the cathedral and
was actually used as a covering for a transport
waggon. Finally, however, it was exhibited in the
Mus&eacute;e Napoleon, in 1803, and was afterwards
returned to Bayeux. In 1840 it was restored and
relined, and is now in the H&ocirc;tel de Ville at Bayeux!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span></p>

<br />
THE GREAT PERIOD OF EMBROIDERY</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Opus Anglicanum"&mdash;The Worcester fragments&mdash;St. Benedict&mdash;Legend
of Pope Innocent&mdash;The "Jesse" cope&mdash;The "Syon" cope.</p></div>


<p>The great period of English embroidery is supposed
to have been from the twelfth to the thirteenth
century. Very little remains to show this, except a
few fragments of vestments from the tombs of the
bishops dating from the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries, and other data obtained from various
foreign inventories of later date referring to the use
of "Opus Anglicanum." Some portion of the
Worcester fragments may be seen in the South
Kensington Museum, and can only be described as
being so perfect in workmanship, colour, and style as
even at this day to be more like a magnificent piece
of goldsmith's work than that of needlecraft. The
background is apparently one mass of thread of fine
gold worked in and out of a silken mesh, the
embroidery appearing just as clear and neat in
manipulation as an illumination. The coloured
photographs, which may be seen in the same room,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></span>
of the stole and maniple of St. Cuthbert are of
precisely the same work. Judging from these, and
the embroidered orphrey which the authorities
bought from the Hockon Collection for &pound;119 1s. 10d.
and which is only 4 feet 8 inches long, there is no
doubt that this was, <i>par excellence</i>, the finest period.
The work can only be described as being like an old
Italian painting on a golden ground. We see precisely
such design and colouring in ancient paintings
for altars as in the old Italian Triptychs. This style
was carried out as literally as possible. Even the
defects, if so they may be called, are there, and a
slight topheaviness of the figures serves but to accentuate
the likeness.</p>

<p>There is a legend that during the times of the
Danish incursions St. Benedict travelled backwards
and forwards through France and Italy, and brought
with him during his <i>seven</i> journeys artificers in <i>glass</i>
and <i>stone</i>, besides costly books and copies of the
Scriptures. The chief end and aim of monastic life,
both of monk and nun, in those early days was to
embroider, paint, and illuminate their sacred books,
vestments, and edifices with what was to them a
newly-inspired faith.</p>

<p>Dr. Rock, in his "Church of Our Fathers," says
that from the twelfth century to the time of Henry
VIII. that only the best materials that could be
found in our country or that of other lands were
employed, and that the art that was used on them
was the best that could be learnt or given. The
original fabrics often came from Byzantium or were
of Saracenic origin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 362px;">

<p>The story of Pope Innocent III., who, seeing
certain vestments and orphreys, and being informed
that they were English, said, "Surely England must
be a garden of delight!" must be quoted to show how
English work was appreciated in those early days.</p>

<p>The choicest example in this country of this
glorious period of English embroidery is the famous
Syon cope, which is supposed to rank as the most
magnificent garment belonging to the Church. It
may be regarded as a typical example of real
English work, the "Opus Anglicanum" or "Anglicum,"
which, although used for other purposes, such
as altar-cloths and altar-frontals, found apparently
its fullest scope in these large semicircular mantles.</p>

<p>Amongst the many copes treasured at South
Kensington there are none, amidst all their splendour,
as fine as this, although the fragment of the "Jesse"
cope runs it very closely. There are many copes of
this period in different parts of the Continent&mdash;the
Daroca Cope at Madrid, one at Ascagni, another
at Bologna, at St. Bertrand-de-Comminges, at "St.
John Lateran" at Rome, at Pienza and Toleda,
and a fragment of one with the famous altar-frontal
at Steeple Aston. These are all assumed
to be of "Opus Anglicanum," and they may be
described as being technically perfect, the stitches
being of fine small tambour stitch, beautifully even,
and the draperies exquisitely shaded.</p>

<p>The illustration showing the Syon Cope requires
some little explanation. It is wrought on linen,
embroidered all over with gold and silver thread and
coloured silk. It is 9 feet 7 inches long, 4 feet 8 inches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span>
wide. The whole of the cope except the border
is covered with interlacing quatrefoils outlined in
gold. The ground of these quatrefoils is covered
with red silk and the spaces between them with
green silk. Each quatrefoil is filled with scenes
from the life of Christ, the Virgin, and figures of
St. Michael and of the Apostles. On the green
spaces are worked figures of six-winged angels standing
on whorls. The chief place on the quatrefoils
is given to the crucifixion, where the body of the
Saviour is worked in silver and cloth of gold. The
Virgin, arrayed in green tunic and golden mantle, is
on one side and St. John, in gold, on the other.
Above the quatrefoil is another representing the
Redeemer seated on a cushioned throne with the
Virgin, and below another representing St. Michael
overcoming Satan. Other quatrefoils show "Christ
appearing to St. Mary Magdalen," "The Burial
of the Virgin," "The Coronation of the Virgin,"
"The Death of the Virgin with the Apostles surrounding
her," "The Incredulity of St. Thomas,"
"St. Simon," "St. Bartholomew," "St. Peter," "St.
Paul," "St. Thomas," "St. Andrew," and "St. James."
Portions of four other Apostles may be seen, but
at some period the cope has been cut down. In its
original state the cope showed the twelve Apostles.
The lower portion has been cut away and reshaped,
and round this is an edging apparently made out of
a stole and maniple which point to a later date,
as they are worked chiefly in cross-stitch. On the
orphrey are emblazoned the arms of Warwick, Castile
and Leon, Ferrars, Geneville Everard, the badge of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">{225}</a></span>
the Knights Templars, Clifford, Spencer, Lindsay,
Le Botelier, Sheldon, Monteney of Essex, Champernoun,
Everard, Tyddeswall Grandeson, Fitz Alan,
Hampden, Percy, Clanvowe, Ribbesford, Bygod,
Roger de Mortimer, Grove, B. Bassingburn, and
many others not recognisable. These coats of arms,
it is suggested, belonged to the noble dames who
worked the border. The angels which fill the intervening
spaces are of the six-winged varieties, each
standing on whorls or wheels.</p>

<br />
(<i>S.K.M Collection.</i>)</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">{227}</a></span>The cope is worked in a fine tambour or chain
stitch principally. All the faces, bodies, and draperies
are composed of this. A specially noticeable point is
that the faces are worked spirally, beginning in the
centre of the cheek and being worked round and
round, conforming with the muscles of the face. The
garments are worked according to the hang of the
drapery, very fine effects being obtained. After the
work has been completed a hot iron something like a
little iron rod with a bulbous end has been pressed
into the cheeks, under the throat, and in different
parts of the nude body. Occasionally, but seldom,
the same device may be seen in the drapery. All
the work is exquisitely fine and perfectly even. The
groundwork of the quatrefoils is of gold-laid or
"couch" work, as is also that of the armorial bearings.</p>

<p>The name "Syon" is somewhat misleading, as the
Cope was not made here, but came into the hands of
the Bridgettine nuns in 1414, when Henry V. founded
the convent of "Syon" at Isleworth. Its origin
and date will ever be a matter of conjecture, but
Dr. Rock infers that Coventry may have been the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">{228}</a></span>
place of its origin. Taking Coventry as a centre
with a small radius, several of the great feudal houses
the arms of which are on the border of the cope may
be found, and Dr. Rock further supposes that Eleanor,
widow of Edward the First, may have become a
sister of the fraternity unknown, as her arms, Castile
and Leon, are on it. "The whole must have taken
long in working, and the probability is that it was
embroidered by nuns of some convent which stood
on or near Coventry." However this may be, it is
certain that this splendid piece of English work
came into the hands, by some means, of the nuns of
Syon, and after remaining with them at Isleworth till
Elizabeth's time, it was carried by them through
Flanders, France, and Portugal. They remained
at the latter place till the same persecution which
dispersed the famous Spanish Point lace over the
length and breadth of the Continent, and about
eighty years ago it was brought back to England,
and was given by the remaining members of the
Order to the Earl of Shrewsbury. After further
vicissitudes of a varied character it was bought by
the South Kensington Museum for &pound;110, and now
sheds the glory of its golden threads in a dark
transept unnoticed except by the student.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">{229}</a></span></p>

<h2>III<br />
<br />
ECCLESIASTICAL EMBROIDERIES AND VESTMENTS</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Pierpont Morgan purchase&mdash;The Steeple Aston Altar-frontal&mdash;The
"Nevil" Altar-frontal at S. K. M.&mdash;City
palls&mdash;Diagram of vestments.</p></div>


<p>Other copes of the same period are in the Madrid
Museum, two copes at Bologna, and the "Ascoli"
cope recently purchased by Mr. J. Pierpont
Morgan and generously returned by him. Some
cushions from Catworth Church, Huntingdon, now
at the South Kensington Museum, were probably
cut from copes, and bought by permission of the
Bishop of Ely for &pound;27. A long band of red
velvet at South Kensington Museum embroidered
with gold and silver and coloured silk has evidently
been made from the "Apparels" of an alb.
It is in two pieces, each piece depicting five scenes
divided by broad arches. The first five are from
the life of the Virgin, and are: "The Angel appearing
to Anna," "The Meeting of Anna and Joachim,"
"Birth of the Virgin," "Presentation of the Virgin,"
"Education of the Virgin." In the second piece
are: "The Annunciation," "The Salutation," "The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">{234}</a></span>
Nativity," "The Angel appearing to the Shepherds,"
and the "Journey of the Magi."</p>

<p>Another piece of similar work is the altar-frontal
of Steeple Aston, which was originally a cope, and
the cope now at Stonyhurst College, originally
belonging to Westminster Cathedral. It is made of
one seamless piece of gold tissue.</p>

<p>During this great period of English embroidery
certain characteristics along with its superb workmanship
must be noticed. The earlier the work the
finer the modelling of the figures. In the figures
of the St. Cuthbert and the Worcester fragments
the proportions of the figures are exquisite; at
a later date, while the work is just as excellent,
the figures become unnatural, the heads being
unduly large, the eyes staring, and the perspective
entirely out of drawing. Until the fourteenth
century this comes so gradually as to be
scarcely noted; but after and through the fifteenth
century this becomes so marked as to be almost
grotesque, and only the genuine religious fervour
with which these poor remnants have been
worked prevents many of them being ridiculous.
The faces gradually show less careful drawing
and working, and the figures become squat and
topheavy. The emblems of the saints are often
omitted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>This decline in the embroiderer's art is specially
noticeable in an extraordinary panel to be seen
at South Kensington Museum, where an altar-frontal
of stamped crimson velvet is appliqued in groups
of figures in gold, silver, and silks. In the middle is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">{237}</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a></span>
the Crucifixion, with the Virgin and St. John standing
on a strip covered with flowers. On the left
is Ralph Nevil, fourth Earl of Westmoreland, 1523,
kneeling, and behind him his seven sons. On the
right is Lady Catherine Stafford, his wife, also
kneeling, and behind her kneel her thirteen
daughters. The frontal cost the museum &pound;50
and is well worth it as an historical document.
Other important embroideries of the period to be
found in England are at Cirencester Cathedral,
Ely Cathedral, Salisbury and Carlisle Cathedrals,
Chipping Norton and Little Dean in Gloucestershire,
East Langdon in Kent, Buckland and
Stourton in Worcester, Littleworth in Leicestershire,
Lynn in Norfolk, and the Parish Church
at Warrington.</p>

<p>Many of the palls belonging to the great city
companies belong to this date. The Saddlers'
Company's pall is of crimson velvet embroidered
with angels surrounding "I.H.S.," and arms of the
Company. The Fishmongers' Pall, made at the end
of the fifteenth century, has at one end the figure of
St. Peter (the patron saint of fishermen) enthroned,
and angels on either side, and at the other end
St. Peter receiving the keys from our Lord. The
Vintners' Pall is made of Italian velvet and cloth
of gold and embroidered with St. Martin of
Tours.</p>

<p>Religious influence characterised the embroideries
of England practically from the ninth to the
sixteenth centuries. Practically all needlework
prior to 1600 is entirely ecclesiastical, and from its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">{238}</a></span>
limited range in choice of subjects barely does
justice to the fine work this period produced.</p>

<p>Dr. Rock says that "few persons of the present
day have the faintest idea of the labour, the
money, the time, often bestowed on old embroideries
which had been designed by the hands of
men and women each in their own craft the best
and ablest of the day."</p>

<p>We do not know the length of time these ancient
vestments occupied in the making, but twenty-six
years is stated to be the period of making the vestments
for the Church of San Giovanni, in Florence.
This is all worked in close stitches similar to our
English work.</p>


<h3><i>Ancient Church Vestments.</i></h3>

<p>The names of the ecclesiastical vestments are
somewhat puzzling to those of us who do not belong
to the Romish Church, or even to the English
High Church. The vestments described are, we
believe, in use in the Romish churches now as in
the early times when church embroidery was the
pleasure and the labour of all classes of English
women. The accompanying diagram will better
illustrate the use of these vestments than a page
of writing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">{240}</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a></span></p>

TUDOR EMBROIDERY</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The influences of the Reformation&mdash;Queen Catherine of
Aragon's needlecraft&mdash;The gorgeous clothes of
Henry VIII.&mdash;Field of the Cloth of Gold&mdash;Queen
Elizabeth's embroideries.</p></div>


<p>After the Reformation and the wholesale destruction
of the cathedrals, monasteries, and churches,
the gentle dames of England found their occupation
gone. The priestly vestments, the sumptuous altar-cloths,
and gorgeous hangings were now needless.
Those which had been the glory of their owners,
and the pictorial representations of Biblical life to the
uneducated masses of people, had been ruthlessly
torn down and destroyed for the sake of the gold
to be found on them. As in the time immediately
preceding the French Revolution, costly embroideries
were unpicked, and the amount of gold and silver
obtained from them became a source of income and
profit to their destroyers.</p>

<p>Apart from her household, women had no other
interests in those days, unless we accept such
anomalies as Lady Jane Grey, who was a marvel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">{248}</a></span>
of learning and wisdom. All their long leisure
hours had been spent, not in improving their minds,
but in beautifying the churches with specimens of
their skill. Catherine of Aragon, one of the unfortunate
queens of Henry VIII., was a notable needlewoman,
and spent much of her short, unhappy time
as Queen of England in embroidery. The lace-making
of Northampton is said to have been
commenced by her during her period of retirement
after her divorce. The "Spanish stitch," which was
known and used in embroidery of that period, was
introduced by her from her own country, and many
examples of her skill in embroidery are to be seen in
the British Museum and the various homes belonging
to our old nobility.</p>

<p>During the reign of Henry VIII. dress became
very sumptuous, as the contemporary pictures of the
times show. Indeed, all the fervour and feeling
which ladies had worked in religious vestments now
seemed to find refuge in the over-elaboration of
personal wear. Very little lace was used, and that
of only a primitive description, so that effect was
produced by embroidery in gold and silver threads
and the use of pearls and precious stones. The
dress of the nobles in the time of Henry VIII.
was especially gorgeous, the coats being thickly
padded and quilted with gold bullion thread, costly
jewels afterwards being sewn in the lozenges. It is
related that after his successful divorce King Henry
gave a banquet to celebrate his marriage to Anne
Boleyn, and wore a coat covered with the jewelled
letters "H," and in the height of his satisfaction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">{249}</a></span>
allowed the ladies to cut or tear away the jewels as
souvenirs of his triumph over Wolsey and Catherine.
It is said that he was left in his underwear, so great
was the competition for these favours! Robes made
of gold tissue, then called Cloth of Gold, were used,
and in Henry's meeting with Francis I. the English
and French armies vied with each other as to which
should present a greater magnificence. The name
"the Field of the Cloth of Gold" remains as a
guarantee of its splendour.</p>

<p>Under the more austere and religious rule of
Queen Mary we might suppose that ecclesiastical
embroidery would have somewhat regained a foothold.
But the landmarks had been entirely swept
away, and we have little to record of the reign,
except that Mary herself was a clever needlewoman
and worked much of her heartache, at the neglect of
her Spanish husband, into her needlework. Her
jealousy of her sister Elizabeth caused the latter to
spend her life away from the pomps and ceremonies
of the Court, and she has left many records of her
handiwork, some well authenticated, as, for example,
the two exquisite book-covers in the British Museum.
Queen Elizabeth cannot, however, be said to have
been in any way a patroness of the art of needlecraft.
Her talent seems rather to have been devoted to
affairs of State&mdash;and her wardrobe! On her death,
at seventy years of age, she left over one thousand
dresses, most of which must have been a cruel weight,
so overburdened were they with stiff bullion and
trimmed with large pearls and jewels. Her dresses
were literally diapered with gold and silver "gimps"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">{250}</a></span>
inset with heavier stones, but little real embroidery is
shown.</p>

<p>Mary Queen of Scots, on the contrary, was a born
needlewoman. During her married life in France
she learned the gentle arts of embroidery and lace-making,
accomplishments which, as in many humbler
women's lives, have served their owners in good stead
in times of loneliness and trouble. The Duke of
Devonshire possesses specimens of Queen Mary's
skill, worked during the long, dreary days of her
imprisonment at Fotheringay. It is said that Queen
Elizabeth was not above helping herself to the
wardrobe and laces that the unfortunate Queen of
Scotland brought with her from France.</p>

<p>Much embroidery must have been worked for the
adornment of the house after the Reformation, but
beyond an occasional old inventory nothing is left
to show it. After the Reformation greater luxury
in living obtained, and instead of the clean or rush-strewn
floors some kind of floor-covering was used.
Furniture became much more ornamental, and the
use of hangings for domestic purposes was common.
Not a thread of these hand-worked hangings remain,
but we have the immense and immediate use of
tapestry, which first became a manufacture of England
in the reign of Henry VIII. It is easy to
conceive that English women would readily seize
upon the idea supplied in tapestry and adapt its
designs to that of embroidery. It is certain that
hangings for the old four-post beds were embroidered,
as in the inventory of Wolsey's great palace
at Hampton Court there is mention of 230 bed-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span>hangings
of English embroidery. Nothing of this
remains, so that its style is simply conjectural; and
we can only suppose these hangings to have been
replicas of the magnificent velvet and satin hangings,
covered with laid or couched gold and silver threads,
such as Catherine of Aragon would bring with her
from Spain. This also would account for their absolute
disappearance. The value of the gold and silver
in embroidery has always been a fertile source of
wealth to the destroyer of ancient fabrics, while many
embroideries worked only in silks have escaped this
vandalism.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a></span></p>

<h2>V<br />
<br />
EARLY NEEDLEWORK PICTURES AND ACCESSORIES</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Petit point"&mdash;old list of stitches&mdash;Stuart bags&mdash;Gloves&mdash;Shoes&mdash;Caps.</p></div>


<p>Towards the end of James I.'s reign it is supposed
that the earliest needlework pictures appeared.
They were obviously literal copies of the tapestries
which had now become of general use in the homes
of the wealthy, being worked in what is known as
"petit point," or "little stitch." This stitch was
worked on canvas of very close quality, with fine
silk thread, one stitch only being taken over the
junction of the warp and the weft of the canvas
instead of the "cross stitch" of later days. Very
few of these specimens are left of an early date.
A panel, measuring 30 inches by 16 inches, in perfect
condition, and dated 1601, was sold at Christie's
Rooms this year for &pound;115. The purchaser, Mr.
Stoner, of King Street, sold it next day at a very
considerable profit.</p>

<p>At this period the workers of these pictures did
not draw upon Biblical subjects for their inspiration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">{258}</a></span>
(with great advantage to the picture, it may be
stated). The subjects were either fanciful adaptations
from real life, with the little people dressed in
contemporary costume, or dainty little mythological
subjects, such as the "Judgment of Paris," "Corydon
wooing Phyllis," with most absurd little castles of
Tudor construction in impossible landscapes, where
the limpid stream meandered down fairy-like hills
into a shining lake, which held dolphins under the
water and water-fowl above it. The illustration
depicts such a specimen, and shows one of these
tiny pictures worked in no less than ten different
stitches of lacework, in addition to the usual petit
point. The number of these stitches is legion. In
the reign of Charles I., John Taylor, the water-poet,
wrote in 1640:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For tent worke, raised worke, first worke, laid worke, net worke,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Brave bred stitch, fisher stitch, Irish stitch, and Queen stitch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Spanish stitch, Rosemary stitch, and mowle stitch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The smarting whip stitch, back stitch, and cross stitch;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All these are good, and this we must allow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they are everywhere in practice now."<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>

</div>

<p>These are not <i>all</i> the stitches in vogue during the
first era of needlework pictures. A single glance at
one of the early specimens, though it may not <i>charm</i>,
fills one with amazement at the amount of toil,
ingenuity, patience, and downright <i>love</i> for the work
the ancient needlewoman must have possessed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">{261}</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a></span>
Not only pictures, however, were made in petit
point. Many dainty little accessories of the toilet
gave scope to the delicate fancy and nimble fingers
of the ladies who had found solace from the cessation
of their labours for the priesthood in making dainty
little handbags and other pretty articles, each a marvel
of minute handicraft. One bag in my possession measures
only four inches square, and is worked on
fine canvas, about forty threads to the square inch,
the design being the favourite Tudor rose, each petal
worked in lace stitch, and raised from the centre which
is made of knots worked with golden hair, flat green
leaves exquisitely shaded, and a charming bit of the
worker's skill in the shape of a pea's pod, open and
raised, showing the tiny little peas in a row. An
exquisitely worked butterfly with raised wings in
lace stitch is on the other side. The grounding of
the whole is run with flat gold thread, making a
"cloth of gold" ground, strings made of similarly
worked canvas, with gold thread and silk tassels
complete a bag fit for the Princess Golden Locks of
our fairy tales. This little bag cost the writer
5 guineas, and was cheap at the price. The South
Kensington Museum have several specimens, and
although many are very exquisite, there is not one
quite so perfect in design nor in such condition.
Other little trifles made in similar style are the
embroidered gauntlets of the buff leather glove worn
at the time. These have become rarer than any
other embroideries, as they were not merely for
ornament but for actual wear. Four or five of these
gauntlet gloves are in the South Kensington Collec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">{262}</a></span>tion,
but are of a later date than the "petit point"
period.</p>

<p>The use of gloves in England was not very general,
we may infer, in the earlier ages of embroidery.
There are certain evidences, however, showing that
the glove was part of the priestly outfit, remains of
gloves having been found on the bones of Thomas &agrave;
Becket when they were transferred from the crypt
of Canterbury Cathedral to the special shrine prepared
for them; and a crimson leather pair, bearing
the sacred monogram in embroidered gold, are preserved
in the New College, Oxford, belonging to the
founder, William of Wykeham, who opened the
college in 1386.</p>

<p>It was not until the fourteenth century that the
wearing of gloves became general, and practically
nothing remains to show what manner of hand-covering
was worn until the Tudor period. Henry VIII.
was exceptionally lavish and extravagant in the use
of handsomely embroidered gloves, and few of his
portraits show him without a sumptuous glove in
one hand. He had gloves for all functions&mdash;like a
modern fashionable woman. A pair of hawking
gloves belonging to him are in the Ashmolean
Museum, Oxford, and in South Kensington is one of
a pair presented by Henry to his friend and Councillor
Sir Anthony Denny. It is of buff, thin leather,
with a white satin gauntlet, embroidered with blue
and red silk in applique work, decorated with seed-pearls
and spangles, and trimmed with gold lace.
The Tudor rose, the crown, and the lion are
worked amidst a splendour of gold and pearls.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">{263}</a></span></p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth must have inherited her love for
gorgeous apparel along with her strong personality
and masterful spirit, as her expenditure for gloves
alone was proverbial. The favourite offering to her
was a pair of gloves, but she was not above accepting
shoes, handkerchiefs, laces, and even gowns from her
faithful and admiring subjects. On her visit to
Oxford in 1578 she was presented by the Chancellor
of the University with a pair of perfumed gloves,
embroidered with gold and set with jewels, which
cost the University sixty shillings, an immense sum
in those days. Other historic gloves are in the
various museums of the country, seldom or never
coming into the open market. In the Braikenridge
Collection sold at Christie's in February of
this year I was able to secure one for &pound;2 12s. 6d.,
immediately afterwards being offered double the
price for it.</p>

<p>The gloves belonging to Charles I. and Queen
Henrietta Maria were very ornamental, and it is
said that even Oliver Cromwell, with all his austerity,
was not proof against the fascination of the
decorated glove.</p>

<p>With Charles II. the embroidered gloves seem to
have vanished along with the stumpwork pictures,
of which more anon.</p>

<p>Dainty shoes were embroidered in those old times.
These, being articles of wear, like the gloves, are very
rare. The same fine petit point work is seen on
them; seed-pearls and in-run gold threads adorn
them, and frequently the Tudor rose, in raised work,
forms the shoe knot. Two pairs in Lady Wolseley's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span>
Collection, sold in 1906, fetched six guineas, and
nine and a half guineas. Tiny pocket-books were
covered with this pretty work, and charming covers
almost as fresh as when they were worked are occasionally
unearthed, made to hold the old-fashioned
housekeeping and cooking books.</p>

<p>One wonders oftentime how many, and yet, alas!
how few, specimens of this old petit point work have
been preserved. It is only during recent years that
the "cult of the antique" has been fashionable, and
is also becoming a source of income and profit to
the many who indulge in its quest. Only members
of learned antiquarian societies or born reliquaries
troubled themselves to acquire ancient articles of
historic interest because they were <i>old</i>, and served
to form the sequence in the fairy tales of Time.
Anything "old" was ruthlessly destroyed, as being
either past wear, shabby, or old-fashioned, and
countless treasures, both in ecclesiastical and secular
art, have at all periods been recklessly destroyed for
the sake of their intrinsic value in gold or jewels.
In the early days of my life I was allowed to pick
out the corals and seed-pearls from an old Stuart
needle picture "for a doll's necklace!" the picture
itself probably going into the "rag-bag" of the mid-Victorian
good housekeeper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span></p>

of needlecraft are the well-known Stuart caskets.
Very interesting and valuable are these charming
boxes, many of them being in a fine state of
preservation, owing to their having been enclosed
in either a wooden or leathern box specially made
to contain them. These queer little boxes are
frequently made in the shape of Noah's ark. The
lid being raised, a fitted mirror is disclosed. The
mirror slides out, and a secret recess may be discovered
to hold letters. The front falls down,
disclosing any number of tiny drawers, each drawer
being silk-lined and the front of it embroidered.
Here, again, we may look for secret drawers. Very
seldom does the drawer run to the width of the
cabinet, but by removing every drawer and carefully
searching for springs or slides many a tiny recess is
disclosed, where costly jewels, and perhaps a love-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span>gage,
has reposed safely from the sight of unworthy
eyes.</p>

<p>Every square inch of these caskets is covered with
embroidery, sometimes in canvas, worked with the
usual scriptural or mythological design, and in others
with white satin, exquisitely embroidered with figures
and floral subjects. Those in best preservation have
been covered with mica, which has preserved both
the colour and the fabric. The fittings are generally
of silver. On the few occasions when these boxes or
caskets come into the market high prices are
realised. Messrs. Christie last year obtained &pound;40
for a good specimen. I have never seen one sold
under &pound;30, and as much as &pound;100 has been given.</p>

<p>Another pretty fancy was to cover small trays,
presumably for the work or dressing table, with
embroidery. Not many of these remain, the wear
of removing them from place to place having been
too much for their staying powers. One in my
possession is a small hexagonal tray with raised
sides, embroidered in coloured silks in floral design,
on what was once white satin. It is by no means
a thing of beauty now, but as a specimen it is interesting,
and "a poor thing, but mine own," which
covers a multitude of shortcomings in these old
relics, fortunately.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">{271}</a></span></p>

<p>Far more frequently met with, though quite
prohibitive in price, are the Stuart embroidered
mirrors, which easily command &pound;80 to &pound;100 in
the salerooms. They are generally set in a frame of
oak, leaving five or six inches (which would otherwise
be covered with carving or veneer) for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">{273}</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a></span>
embroidery. The mirror itself is comparatively small,
being only a secondary consideration, and often little
remains of it for its original purpose, as the glass
is blurred and the silvering gone. Many of these
mirrors have <i>bevelled</i> glass, which, of course, is
wrong.</p>

<p>The mirror shown in the illustration is one
recently belonging to Viscountess Wolseley and sold
by her, among other Stuart needlework specimens, at
Messrs. Puttick &amp; Simpson's in 1906. This mirror
sold for &pound;100. The figures represent Charles I.
and Queen Henrietta Maria, one on either side of
the mirror. The figure at the top of the frame is
difficult to understand; whether she is an angel or
a mere Court lady must be left to conjecture. The
rolling clouds and the blazing sun are above her
head, and a peacock, with tail displayed, is on one
side and a happy-looking stag on the other. Two
royal residences adorn the topmost panels on
either side, with all their bravery of flying flags
and smoking chimneys, and the lion and the leopard
occupy the lower panels. The latter animal identifies
the King and Queen, who might otherwise be
Charles II. and his consort, as after Charles I.'s time
the leopard gave place to the unicorn for some unexplained
reason. Other typical little Stuart animals
and birds fill in the extra panels, such as the
spotted dog who chases a little hare who is never
caught, and the gaily-coloured parroquet and kingfisher,
which no respectable Stuart picture would be
without. The caterpillar, the ladybird, and the snail
are all <i>en evidence</i>; and below is a real pond,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">{274}</a></span>
covered with talc, and containing fish and ducks,
the banks being made of tiny branching coral beads
and tufted silk and bullion work.</p>

<p>About this time, when Venetian lace came into
fashionable use as an adjunct to the exquisite Stuart
dress, tiny coloured beads were imported from Venice.
The embroiderers at once seized upon them as a new
and possibly more lasting means of showing their
pretty fancies in design. Many delightful specimens
of these beadwork pictures are preserved, the colours,
of course, being as fresh as yesterday. The ground
was always of white satin, now faded and discoloured
with age, and often torn with the heaviness of the
beadwork design. They are scarcely so charming
as the all needlework pictures, but still are delightful
and covetable articles. The exigencies of the beadwork,
however, lends a certain stiffness and ungainliness
to the figures.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">{275}</a></span></p>

<h2>VII<br />
<br />
EMBROIDERED BOOKS AND "BLACK WORK"</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Style and symbolism&mdash;Specimen in British Museum and
Bodleian Libraries&mdash;"Black work"</p></div>


<p>Among the many dainty examples of Tudor and
Stuart needlework are to be found the exquisitely
embroidered book-covers which date from
Queen Elizabeth's girlhood until the time of
Charles II. They were always of diminutive size,
and many stitches diversify their covering; oftentimes
they were liberally embroidered with seed-pearls,
and in these instances most frequently this
fashion has been their salvation. A book somehow
always seems to be a more sacred thing than a
picture, and the costly little volumes which remain
to show this dainty handicraft have apparently
always been used either for Church or private
devotional purposes.</p>

<p>The designs of the book-covers almost always
follow certain styles. These are either heraldic,
scriptural, symbolical, floral, or arabesque.</p>

<p>The first-named variety usually belonged to royalty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">{280}</a></span>
or one of the many noble houses whose ladies busied
themselves with fair needlework. The shield, containing
the coat of arms of the family, occupied the
centre of the book-cover, being formed in raised gold
and silver guipure or cord, and on the reverse the
worker's initials frequently appear, with a pretty
border in gold and silver, to outline the edges.</p>

<p>The scriptural book-covers are always worked on
canvas in fine petit point stitches. One in South
Kensington Museum is larger than most of these
volumes, and has on one side Solomon in all his
glory and on the reverse Jacob and his ladder and
King David. These canvas-covered books appear to
have suffered most from the wear and tear of time,
and very few remain.</p>

<p>The symbolical covers are few, and mostly uninteresting.
They are worked as a rule on silk
and satin in loose satin stitches, which have
suffered much from friction. The sacred monogram
is often the centre of the device. A favourite
design was adorning the back of the books with
portraits of the martyred King Charles I., Queen
Henrietta Maria, and the popular Duke of
Buckingham.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">{281}</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>The stitches used were generally chain-stitch, split-stitch,
petit point, and lace-stitch; and the patterns
were most frequently outlined with a gimp made
of flattened spiral wire, or <i>purl</i>, which was a fine
copper wire covered with coloured silks and cut
in lengths for use. Very often, also, small silver
spangles were employed, either stitched down with a
piece of purl or a seed-pearl. Frequently the covers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">{283}</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a></span>
were of velvet with the designs appliqu&eacute;d down to it,
and <i>laid</i> or <i>couch</i> work outlined the designs. Sometimes
flat pieces of metal were cut to shape and
stitched down, as in one instance where the corners
of the books were trimmed with the rays of the sun
cut in gold, and stitched over with a gold thread.</p>

<p>Many of the charming little bags of which mention
has already been made are supposed to have been
worked to hold the Prayer Book and Book of
Psalms, without which no devout lady deemed herself
fully equipped.</p>

<p>The most famous book is Queen Elizabeth's
Book in the British Museum. The cover is of choice
green velvet, the flat of the back has five roses embroidered
in lace, raised stitches and gold and pearl.
The Royal Arms are on either side of the book in
a lozenge of red silk and pearls. The whole design,
apart from this, is worked in red and white roses
and scrolls of gold and silk. This gorgeous little
cover contains "The Mirrour of Glasse of the
Synneful Soul," written by Elizabeth herself, and
of it she writes that she "translated it out of french
ryme into english prose, joyning the sentences together
as well as the capacities of my symple witte
and small lerning could extende themselves." It is
dedicated "To our most noble and virtuous Queen
Katherine [Katherine Parr] from Assherige, the last
day of the year of our Lord God, 1544."</p>

<p>In the Bodleian Library there is another treasured
little book, again worked by Queen Elizabeth. It
is only 7 inches by 5 inches, and has the same
design on both sides. In this the ground is what is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">{284}</a></span>
known as "tapestry stitch," worked in thick, pale-blue
silk, and the design is of interlacing gold and
silver threads with a Tudor rose in each corner.
"K. P." is marked on the cover, and shows that this
also was worked for Queen Katherine Parr.</p>

<p>Yet another little book is in the British Museum.
It contains a prayer composed by Queen Katherine
Parr, and is written on vellum by Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The cover illustrated is a typical example of the
class of embroidered works of the period. Later the
covers showed less intricate work, and finally developed
into mere velvet covers embroidered with
silver or gold.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">{285}</a></span></p>

<h3>BLACK WORK.</h3>

<p>A curious phase of Old English embroidery is the
well-known "Black Work," which is said to have been
introduced by Catherine of Aragon into England, and
was also known as "Spanish work." The work itself
was a marvel of neatness, precision, and elegant
design, but the result cannot be said to have been
commensurate with the labour of its production.
Most frequently the design was of scroll-work, worked
with a fine black silk back-stitching or chain-stitch.
Round and round the stitches go, following each
other closely. Bunches of grapes are frequently
worked solidly, and even the popular peascod is
worked in outline stitch, and often the petit point
period lace stitches are copied, and roses and birds
worked separately and after stitched to the design.
There are many examples of this famous "Spanish"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">{287}</a></span>
work in the South Kensington Museum. Quilts,
hangings, coats, caps, jackets, smocks are all to
be seen, some with a couched thread of gold and
silver following the lines of the scrolls. This is
said to be the Spanish stitch referred to in the
old list of stitches, and very likely may be so, as the
style and manner are certainly not English; and we
know that Catherine of Aragon brought wonders of
Spanish stitchery with her, and she herself was devoted
to the use of the needle. The story of how
when called before Cardinal Wolsey and Campeggio,
to answer to King Henry's accusations, she had a
skein of embroidery silk round her neck is well
known.</p>

<p>The black silk outline stitchery or linen lasted well
through the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
Very little of it is seen outside the museums, as, not
being strikingly beautiful or attractive, it has been
destroyed.</p>

<p>Another phase of the same stitchery was working
cotton and linen garments, hangings, and quilts in
a kind of quilted pattern with yellow silk.</p>

<p>Anything more unlike the quilting of fifty years
ago cannot be imagined. The finest materials
were used, the padding being placed bit by bit in
its place&mdash;not in the wholesale fashion of later
years, when a sheet or two of wadding was placed
between the sheets of cotton or linen, and a coarse
back-stitching outlined in great scrawling patterns
held the whole together. The old "quilting" work
was made in tiny panels, illustrating shields and
other heraldic devices, and had a surface as fine as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">{288}</a></span>
carved ivory. When, as in the case of one sample
at South Kensington, the quilt is additionally embroidered
with beautiful fine floss silk flowers, the
effect is very lovely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">{289}</a></span></p>

<h2>VIII<br />
<br />
STUART PICTURES</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Petit point"&mdash;"Stump work"&mdash;Royalistic symbols.</p></div>


<p>Though these pictures bear the name of Stuart,
many of them are undoubtedly Tudor. The earliest
(if the evidence of costume is of any value) must
have been worked in Elizabeth's time, but as the
authenticated specimens date only from the reign
of James I. they are known as Stuart. The only
pictures worked in the early days of this art were
worked in petit-point, the tiny stitch which imitated
tapestry, and very quaint are the specimens left
to us. The favourite themes were entirely pagan.
Gods and goddesses disported themselves among leafy
trees. Cupid lightly shot his arrows, the woods were
inhabited by an unknown flora and fauna which seem
all its own. The very dogs seem to be a different
species, having more likeness to the china dogs of
the spotted or liver and white variety which the
Staffordshire potters made at the beginning of our
own century. Innumerable little castles were perched
in perfectly inaccessible positions on towering crags,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">{292}</a></span>
and the laws of perspective were generally conspicuous
by their absence. The sun in those days
was a very visible body, and apparently delightful to
work, no Stuart picture being without one; the
rolling clouds oftentimes are confused with the convoluted
body of the caterpillar, little difference being
made in the design. The birds were of very brilliant
plumage, and the world was evidently a very gay
and sportive place when these fair ladies spent their
leisure over this embroidery! These early pictures
seldom show the religious feeling that afterwards
slowly worked its way through the Stuart days
(though, perhaps, disguised under royalistic symbolism),
until in the reign of Queen Anne it became
more or less a fashion, in pictorial needle-craft.
It burst out afresh in the early nineteenth century
and became an absolute obsession of the early
Victorian Berlin-wool workers with most disastrous
results to both design and work.</p>

<p>Until the end of Charles I.'s reign needlework
pictures must have been scarce, as we find one
enumerated in the inventory of his "Closet of
Rarities." It is possible that the many pictures
which represent Charles I. were worked by loyalist
ladies, <i>after his execution</i> and <i>during the Commonwealth</i>.
In many of these pictures his own hair is
said to have been used, thereby becoming relics of
him who was known as "the Martyred King." On
a very finely worked portrait of Charles I., at South
Kensington Museum, King Charles's hair is worked
amongst the silken threads.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">{293}</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Throughout this time, no matter what the subjects,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">{295}</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a></span>
most of which were notably striking scenes from
Scripture history, such as "Esther and King Ahasuerus,"
"Solomon and the Queen of Sheba," "The
Judgment of Solomon" (a very favourite subject),
and other scenes of Old Testament history, all
the kings were Charles I. and all the Queens
Henrietta Maria. One and all wore early Stuart
costumes. Even Pharaoh's daughter wore the handsome
dress of the day, with Point lace falling collar
and real pearls round her neck. It is a fashion to
jeer at this anachronism; but may it not perhaps
be that we take these pictures too literally, and deny
the workers their feelings of passionate devotion to
the lost cause. Doubtless they worked their loyalty
to their beloved monarch into these pretty and
pleasing fancies, just as it is said that the fashion
of "finger-bowls" was introduced later so that the
loyal gentlemen of the day might drink to the King
"<i>over the water</i>." I see no cause to deny intelligence
to these dear dead women, who were capable of
exquisite needlecraft and fine design, and whose
devotion was shown in many instances by giving
up jewels, houses, and lands for the King!</p>

<p>The fashion of "stump" or stamp work appears
to have been derived from Italy. Italian needlework
of this time abounds with it, and, it must be
admitted, of a superior design, and style to that
which was known here as "stump" work. Until the
eighteenth century English work was more or less
archaic in every branch. Personally, I see no more
absurdity in the queer doll-like figures than in contemporary
wood-carving. It was a period of tenta<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">{296}</a></span>tive
effort, and was, of course, beneath criticism.
English Art has ever been an effort until its one
bright burst of genius in the eighteenth century,
while the continental nations appear to have breathed
artistic perception with life itself.</p>

<p>The prototype of our stump work pictures, the
Italian raised work, are gracious, graceful figures
perfectly proportioned, and set in lovely elegant
arabesques, with no exaggeration of style or period.
Some specimens of this work must have been brought
from Italy, through France, and the English workers
quickly adopted and adapted them to their own
heavier intelligence. Some of the little figures are
certainly very grotesque. Frequently the tiny little
hands are larger than the heads, but the <i>stitchery</i>
is exquisite.</p>

<p>No time seems to have been too long to have been
spent in perfecting the petals of a rose, the loose
wing of a butterfly, or to make a realistic curtain in
fine Point lace stitches to hang from the King's
canopy. Some of the King's dresses are said to have
been made of tiny treasured pieces of his garments.
There is no doubt that much devoted sentiment was
worked into these little figures, and these touches of
nature add a pathetic interest to them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">{297}</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>In the illustration of "King Solomon receiving the
Queen of Sheba" from the South Kensington Collection
Solomon is obviously King Charles I., while
the Queen of Sheba is equally recognisable as Queen
Henrietta Maria. The picture is perhaps the finest
in the Kensington Collection, the colours being fresh
and the work intact. The little faces are worked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">{299}</a></span>
over a padding of soft frayed silk or wool, the
features being drawn in fine back-stitch. Natural
hair is worked on the King's and Queen's heads,
and the crowns are real gold thread set with pearls.
The canopy is worked <i>solidly</i> in silk and gold
thread, and from it hang loose curtains in old
brocade, worked over and over with gold and silken
thread.</p>

<p>The King's mantle and that of the Lord Chamberlain
are worked in Point lace stitches, afterwards
applied to the bodies and hanging loosely. The
Queen's dress is brocade, worked over with gold and
silver, while strings of real pearls decorate the necks
and wrists of the ladies, and real white lace of the
Venetian variety trims the neck and sleeves of these
fairy people. The Stuart castle we see perched
up among the trees and touching the sun's beams is
more like an English farmhouse than Whitehall.
Yet either this or Windsor Castle is always supposed
to be represented.</p>

<p>The British lion and the leopard, again, make the
identity of these little people more certain. The
quaint little trees bear most disproportionate fruits,
the acorn and pears being about the same size, but
all beautifully worked in Point-lace stitches over
wooden moulds. The hound and the hare, the
butterfly and the grub, and the strange birds make
up one of the most typical Stuart pictures.</p>

<p>The next illustration shows another development
of picture-making. Here the grounding is of white
satin, as in the previous illustration, but the figures
are worked on canvas separately, in fine petit-point<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">{300}</a></span>
stitch, afterwards being cut away and placed on the
white satin ground with a few silk stitches and the
whole outlined with a fine black silk cord. The
subject is "The Finding of Moses," and is as full of
anachronisms as the last, only that here again
Pharaoh's daughter is worked in memory of Queen
Henrietta Maria, and the tiny boy in the corner is
Charles II., and Moses the infant Duke of York.
The four-winged cherubs are the guardian angels who
are watching over the lost fortunes of the Stuart
family, and the rose of England and the lilies of
France which form the border are emblematical
of the royal lineage of their lost King's family.
The hound and hare still chase each other gaily
round the border, and in the picture the hare is
seen emerging, like the Stuarts, from exile and
obscurity.</p>

<p>Sufficient has perhaps been said to cause those
who possibly may have misunderstood these pictures
to give them another glance, and allow imagination
to carry them back to the times of the exiled Royal
Family and their brave adherents, whose women
allowed not their memories to slumber nor their
labours to flag. These pictures must have been
made during the Commonwealth and the reign of
Charles II. In no case, to my knowledge, has King
Charles II. been depicted in stitchery, nor yet
Catherine of Braganza. James II. is equally ignored,
and with him their mission seemed to have been
accomplished. Possibly the people had had by this
time sufficient of the Stuarts, and the memory of
King Charles the martyr had waxed dim. Certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">{301}</a></span>
it is that with James II. Stuart needlework pictures
suddenly ceased.</p>

<h3><i>Stump work Symbols.</i></h3>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">{303}</a></span>The symbolism of the various animals, birds, insects,
and flowers which are, apparently without
rhyme or reason, placed in one great disarray in
the Stuart pictures is said to have been heraldic
and symbolic. The sunbeam coming from a cloud,
the white falchion, and the chained hart are heraldic
devices belonging to Edward III.</p>

<p>The buck and the strawberry, which are so often
seen, belong to the Frazer Clan of Scotland, and may
have been worked by ladies who were kith and kin
of this clan.</p>

<p>The unicorn was the device of James I. and the
siren or mermaid of Lady Frazer, who is said to
have worked her own golden hair in the heart of a
Tudor rose on a book cover for James I.</p>

<p>The hart was also a device of Richard II. and the
"broom pod" of the Plantagenets. The caterpillar
and butterfly were specially badges of Charles I.,
while the oak-tree and acorn were invariably worked
into every picture in memory of Charles II.'s escape
in an oak tree.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">{305}</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a></span></p>

<h2>IX<br />
<br />
SAMPLERS</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Real art work&mdash;Specimens in South Kensington Museum&mdash;High
price now obtained.</p></div>


<p>A "sampler" is an example or a sample of the
worker's skill and cleverness in design and stitching.
When they first appeared, as far as we know about
the middle of the seventeenth century, they were
merely a collection of embroidery, lace, cut and
drawn work stitches, and had little affinity to the
samplers of a later date, which seemed especially
ordained to show various patterns of cross stitches,
the alphabet, and the numerals.</p>

<p>The early samplers were real works of art; they
were frequently over a yard long, not more than a
quarter of a yard wide, and were adorned with
as many as thirty different patterns of lace and cut
and drawn work. This extreme narrowness was to
enable the sampler to be rolled on a little ivory
stick, like the Japanese <i>kakemonas</i>.</p>

<p>The foundation of all the early samplers was a
coarse linen, and to this fact we owe the preservation
of many of them. Those made two hundred years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">{308}</a></span>
later, on a coarse, loose canvas, even now show signs
of decay, while these ancient ones on linen are as
perfect as when made, only being gently mellowed
by Time to the colour of old ivory.</p>

<p>The earliest sampler known is dated 1643, and was
worked by Elizabeth Hinde. It is only 6 inches by
6&frac12; inches, and is entirely lacework, and apparently has
been intended for part of a sampler. The worker
perhaps changed her mind and considered rightfully
that she had accomplished her <i>chef d'&oelig;uvre</i>, or as
so often explains these unfinished specimens, the
Reaper gathered the flower, and only this dainty
piece of stitching was left to perpetuate the memory
of Elizabeth Hinde.</p>

<p>The sampler in question is just one row of cut
and drawn work and another of fine Venetian lacework,
worked in "punto in aria." A lady in Court
dress holds a rose to shield herself from Cupid, a
dear little fellow with wings, who is shooting his
dart at her heart. Perhaps poor Elizabeth Hinde
died of it and this is her "swan song."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">{309}</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>The earliest samplers appeared to have been
worked only on white cotton or silk. A favourite
design, apart from the lacework samplers, was the
"damask pattern" sampler, a specimen of which may
be noted, commencing with the fifth row, on the
sampler illustrated. Sometimes the sampler was
entirely composed of it, and although ineffective,
remains as a marvel of skill. It was worked entirely
in flat satin stitch and eyelet holes, known as the
"bird's eye" pattern. In the illustration four rows
of cutwork will be noted, followed by five rows of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">{311}</a></span>
drawn threadwork, and above are patterns worked
in floral and geometric designs in coloured silks.
The alphabet and the date 1643 complete this
monument of skill, which may be seen in the South
Kensington Museum.</p>

<p>The succeeding illustration shows a more ambitious
attempt, and is considered one of the finest specimens
known. It was worked by Elizabeth Mackett,
1696. It is on white linen with ten rows of floral
patterns worked with coloured silks in cross, stem,
and satin stitches, with some portions worked
separately and applied. Five rows of white satin
stitch, two rows of alphabet letters in coloured silks,
and four rows of exquisite punto in aria lace patterns
are followed by the alphabet again in white stitches
and the maker's name and date. The sampler is
in superb preservation, the colours are particularly
rich and well chosen. This sampler is also from the
South Kensington Collection. Often the worker's
name is followed by a verse or rhyme having a
delightfully prosaic tendency. One can imagine
the poor girls, in the early days we are writing of,
writhing under the infliction of having slowly and
painstakingly to work the solemn injunction&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When this you see remember me<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And keep me in your mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And be not like a weathercock<br /></span>

<span class="i2">When I should be forgotten."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">{312}</a></span></div></div>

<p>And we can appreciate how little Maggie Tulliver
("The Mill on the Floss ") must have girded at the
philosophy she was compelled to work into her
sampler&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Look well to what you take in hand,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When land is gone and money is spent<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then learning is most excellent."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With the eighteenth century the beauty of the
Samplers distinctly declined. They became squarer,
and were bordered with a running pattern, and the
whole canvas became more or less pictorial. Inevitably
the end of this art came. Ugly realistic
bowpots with stumpy trees decorated the picture
in regular order. The alphabet still appeared, and
moral reflection seemed to be the aim of the worker
rather than to make the Sampler show beauty of
stitchery. Quaint little maps of England are often
seen, surrounded with floral borders, but it remained
to the early nineteenth century to show how the
Sampler became reduced to absurdity. One of the
quaintest and most amusing Samplers at South
Kensington is a 12-inch by 8-inch example in woollen
canvas and embroidered with coloured silk. At the
lower end is a soldier, a tiny realistic house, a
dovecot, any number of flowering plants, a stag and
other animals. Above is a band of worked embroidery
enclosing the words, "This is my dear
Father." The remaining spaces are filled in with
angels blowing trumpets, double-headed eagle, peacocks
and other birds, and baskets of fruit. In spite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">{313}</a></span>
of its absurdity, this little piece is far more pleasant
than the tombstone inscriptions which abound, and
is, after all, delightfully suggestive of home and
affection.</p>

<p>Then follows a house called "The Queen's Palace,"
standing in an enclosed flower-garden. This masterpiece
of moral philosophy from the hands of a child
of seven years is dated 1813.</p>

<p>An exaggerated conception of the value of old
Samplers is very widely spread. Only the seventeenth-century
Samplers are really of consequence, and these
fetch fancy prices. In the sale-rooms a long narrow
Sampler of lace stitches and drawn-thread work would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">{316}</a></span>
bring as much as a handsome piece of lace. They
are practically unattainable, and in this case the law
of supply and demand does not obtain. It is beyond
the needlewomen of the present day to imitate these
old Samplers. Life is too short, and demands upon
time are so many and varied, that a lifetime of
work would result in making only one. Therefore,
the fortunate owners of these seventeenth-century
Samplers may cherish their possessions, and those
less lucky possess their souls in patience, and hoard
their golden guineas in the hope of securing one.
Twenty years ago a few pounds would have been
ample to secure a fine specimen, but &pound;30 will now
secure only a short fragment.</p>

<p>During the last three years I have not seen a
good Sampler at any London Curio or lace shop,
and none appear in the sale-rooms. The eighteenth-century
Samplers are comparatively common, the
map variety especially so, and can be purchased for
a pound or so, but these are not desirable to the
collector.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">{317}</a></span></p>

<br />
THE WILLIAM AND MARY EMBROIDERIES</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Queen Mary "a born needlewoman"&mdash;The Hampton Court
Embroideries&mdash;Revival of petit point&mdash;Jacobean
hangings.</p></div>


<p>One of the most convincing facts in arguments that
there <i>is</i> a revival in the gentle art of needlecraft is
that it has become the fashion to drape our windows,
cover our furniture, and panel our walls with printed
copies of the Old Jacobean needlework. Many people,
knowing nothing whatever about the history of needlework,
wonder where the designs for the printed linens
which line the windows of Messrs. Liberty, Goodall
and Burnett's colossal frontages in Regent Street
have been found. In time amazement gives way to
admiration for these quaint blues and greens, roses
and pale yellows, worked in great scrolls with exotic
flowers and still more exotic birds, and the funny
little hillocks with delightful little pagoda-like
cottages nestling amongst them, and many and
various little animals which seem to keep perpetual
holiday under the everlasting blooms. The designs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">{322}</a></span>
are taken bodily from the historical hangings of the
later seventeenth century. After the abdication and
flight of James II. to St. Germains, his daughter
Mary came over with her Dutch husband, William
the Stadtholder&mdash;or, rather, William came over and
brought his wife, the daughter of the late king, for
William had no intention of assuming the style and
life of Prince Consort, but came well to the front,
and kept there. It was not "<span class="smcap">Victoria</span> <i>and Albert</i>"
in those days, but <span class="smcap">William</span> and <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, who ruled
England, and ruled it well. William III. must
have been a man of strong personality, and he
managed to quell all the rebellions of his reign,
and during the time he ruled over us the country
settled down to a peaceful state that has remained to
the present time.</p>

<p>Queen Mary had quite sufficient employment in
settling herself and her household, and generally
managing the domestic matters pertaining to the
new kingdom she had come into. She apparently
had a very free hand in rebuilding Hampton Court,
which she particularly made her home, absolutely
pulling the interior down, and rebuilding and redecorating
it according to her own taste, which
was not that of the Stuart persuasion with its
gorgeous magnificence, but the more homely and
solid Dutch. Very little of the original Hampton
Court <i>interior</i>, built and furnished by Cardinal Wolsey,
exists. Just here and there we find delightfully dark
little dens with the original linen-fold panellings and
ceilings that are a ravishment to look upon; but
mostly the rooms are high, plain-panelled, and with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">{323}</a></span>
the quaint ingle-nook fireplaces, with shelves above,
upon which Mary placed her lovely "blue and white"
porcelain which had been brought to her by the
Dutch merchants who at that time were the great
traders of the sea.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">{325}</a></span>Queen Mary ought to be regarded as the patron
saint of English needlewomen. She was happiest
when employed furnishing every bed-covering, every
chair and stool, and supplying the hangings for her
favourite home. It is said that she spent her days
over her embroidery frame, knowing full well that
affairs of State were in the capable hands of her
husband.</p>

<p>There are few relics left of her handiwork outside
Hampton Court. She left no dainty little book-covers,
bags, or boxes, as her ideas were fixed on
larger pieces of embroidery. Had she lived in the
Berlin-wool picture days, she would have filled every
nook and cranny with these atrocities, as many
humbler devotees to the needle have done to our
own knowledge. Needlework can become a <i>passion</i>,
and certainly Queen Mary must have possessed it.</p>

<p>After the complete collapse of the Stuart stump
pictures, when every vestige of loyalty seems to have
been swept away with the hated James II., the ancient
Petit Point pictures came back into fashion. Very
clever work was put into them, but, alas! their scope
was purely to depict religious scenes of the rigorous
kind. No dainty fairy-like little people now ruled in
pictured story, but actual representations of Bible
history.</p>

<p>The illustration of "The Baptism of the Ethi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">{326}</a></span>opian
Eunuch by St. Philip" is a fair sample of the
needlework picture of this time. The picture is a
strange mixture of the early Stuart Petit Point, the
Jacobean wall-hanging, and the newly revived religious
spirit. The duck-pond, the swans and the water-plants
might have been copied bodily from James I.'s time.
The paroquet and the flying bird, and the immense
leaves and blossoms, are direct from the wall-hangings,
while the figures only too surely foretell the
coming dark days of needlecraft, when a Scripture
picture and a coarsely worked sampler were part of
every girl's liberal education. The work in this
picture is extremely good, and it is excruciatingly
funny without intending to be so. The pretty little
equipage with its diminutive ponies surely was never
intended to carry either St. Philip or the Eunuch!
The open book, with Hebraic inscription, is very
delightful. It brings to mind the Tables of the Law
rather than the light reading that the charming little
Cinderella coach should carry.</p>

<p>These pictures are not common, and we scarcely
know whether to be thankful for them or not.
Unlike the early petit point, they were worked in
<i>worsteds</i>, whereas the early pictures were wrought
in silk. The moth has a natural affinity for wool, as
we all know, and his tribe has cleared off many
hundreds of examples. Why so many of the old
Jacobean hangings remain is that they were worked
for <i>use</i>, and not ornament, and even after they ceased
to be fashionable ornaments for sitting and bed
rooms, they were either relegated to the servants'
quarters, or given to dependants, who used them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">{327}</a></span>
constantly, shaking and keeping them in repair, as
the eighteenth-century housewives liked to keep
their homes swept and garnished.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">{329}</a></span>It is strange to see these old Jacobean hangings
(perhaps the drapery of the now tabooed four-post
bedstead), which might some thirty years ago have
been carried off for the asking, sell at Christie's for
&pound;800, as happened in the dispersal of the Massey-Mainwaring
sale last year. Even a panel of no use
except to frame as a picture, say 4 feet by 3 feet, will
fetch &pound;30 and a full-sized bed-cover can only be
bought for over &pound;100. The reason is not far to seek.
The colouring and the drawing of this fine old Crewel-work
are exquisite (even though the design savours
of the grotesque), and Time has dealt very leniently
with the dyes. I endeavoured to match some of
these old worsteds a little time ago, and though
able to find the colours, could not get the tone.
After much tribulation I was advised to hang the
skeins of worsted on the trees in the garden and
<i>forget all about them</i>, and certainly wind and weather
have softened the somewhat garish worsteds to the
soft, <i>fade</i> colours of the old work.</p>

<p>The same class of embroidery was executed
during the reign of Queen Anne, though she herself
did little of it. Costly silks and brocades and Venetian
laces were the dress of the day, and no little dainty
accessories appear to have been made.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">{331}</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a></span></p>

<h2>XI<br />
<br />
PICTORIAL NEEDLEWORK OF THE EIGHTEENTH
CENTURY</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The "painted faces" period&mdash;Method of production&mdash;Revival
of Scriptural "motifs"&mdash;Modern fakes&mdash;Black silk and
hair copies of engravings.</p></div>


<p>An immense number of pictures must have been
worked during the eighteenth century. Almost, we
might say, no English home is without an example.
Much of the work is intensely bad, and only that
Time has tenderly softened the colours, and the old-time
dresses add an element of quaintness to the
pictures, can they be tolerated. Works of art they
are not, and, indeed, were never intended to occupy
the place their owners now proudly claim for them.
Just here and there a picture of the painted face
type is a masterpiece of stitchery, as in the example
illustrated, where every thread has been worked by an
<i>artiste</i>. Looking at this little gem across a room, the
effect is that of a charming old colour print, so
tenderly are the lines of shading depicted. This
is the only picture of this class that I have seen
for years as an absolutely perfect specimen of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">{336}</a></span>
eighteenth-century silk pictures, though doubtless
many exist.</p>

<p>The discrepancy which is usually found is that,
although the design and outline is perfect, the faces
and hands exquisitely painted, the needlework part
of the picture has been executed in a foolish, inartistic
manner, and no method of light and shade has
been observed. Some little time ago I published
an article in one of the popular monthly Magazines
illustrating this same picture, and was afterwards
inundated with letters from correspondents from far
and near sending their pictures for valuation and&mdash;admiration!
Not one of these pictures was good,
though there were varying degrees of <i>badness</i>. But
in no instance was the painted face crudely drawn or
badly coloured.</p>

<p>The explanation is that just as the modern needlewoman
goes to a Needlework Dep&ocirc;t and obtains
pieces of embroidery already commenced and the
design of the whole drawn ready for completion, so
these old needle pictures were sold ready for
embroidering, the outline of the trees sketched in
fine sepia lines, the distant landscape already
painted, the faces and hands of the figures charmingly
coloured, in many instances by first-class artists.
When we remember that the eighteenth century was
<i>par excellence</i> the great period of English portrait
painting and colour printing, we can understand that
possibly really fine artists were willing to paint these
exquisite faces on fine silk and satin, just as good
artists of the present day often paint "pot-boilers"
while waiting for fame.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">{337}</a></span></p>

<p>Angelica Kauffmann's style was often copied. Is it
too much to believe that some of these charming faces
may have been from her hands? We know that she
painted furniture and china, therefore why not the
faces of the needlework pictures so nearly akin to
her own work?</p>

<p>The eighteenth-century costume was particularly
adapted to this pretty work. We cannot imagine
the voluminous robes of Queen Mary or Queen Anne
in needle-stitchery, but the soft, silky lawns of the
Georgian periods, the high-waisted bodices, the
<i>bouffant</i> fichus and the flowing head-dresses, all
were specially easy and graceful to work. Many of
the pretty children Sir Joshua loved to paint were
copied. "Innocence" made a charming picture,
and several of the less rustic Morland pictures were
copied.</p>

<p>We would imagine that when the beginnings of
the picture were so glorious the needlewoman would
have made some endeavour to work up to it. But,
alas! it was not so. Though often the stitching is
neat and small, not an idea of shading seems to have
entered the worker's mind, and whole spaces, nay, a
complete garment, are often worked solid in one tone
of colour! On the whole there is far more artistic
sense and feeling in the Stump pictures it is the
fashion to deride.</p>

<p>Not always were dainty pastoral and domestic
scenes worked. Very ghastly creations are still
existent of scriptural subjects. Coarsely worked
in wool, instead of silk, or in a mixture of both.
The painting is still good, but the work and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">{340}</a></span>
subjects are execrable! "Abraham about to sacrifice
Isaac," on the pile of faggots already laid,
and Isaac bound on it, with a very woolly lamb
standing ready as a substitute, was a favourite subject.
"Abraham dismissing Hagar and Ishmael,"
with a malignant-looking Sarah in the distance, vies
with the former in popularity. "The Woman of
Samaria," and "The Entombment," are another pair
of unpleasant pictures which we are often called
upon to admire.</p>

<p>The best of these pictures were worked in fine
floss silk, not quite like the floss silk of to-day, as
it had more twist and body in it, with just a little
fine chenille, and very tiny bits of silver thread to
heighten the effect. The worst were worked in
<i>crewel</i> wools of crude colours. Fortunately, the
moth has a special predilection for these pictures,
and they are slowly being eaten out of existence,
in spite of being cherished as heirlooms and works
of art.</p>

<p>Another pretty style which we seldom meet with
was some part of the picture covered with the almost
obsolete "&aelig;rophane," a kind of chiffon or crape
which was much in request even up to fifty years ago.
A certain part of the draperies was worked on the
silk ground, without any attempt at finish. This
was covered with &aelig;rophane, and outlined so as to
attach it to the figure. This again was worked upon
with very happy effects, very fine darning stitches
making the requisite depth of shading. The illustration
shows the use of this, but this cannot be said
to be a very good specimen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">{341}</a></span></p>

<p>These painted face, silk-worked pictures are the
only needlework examples the collector <i>need to
beware of</i>, as they are being reproduced by the
score. The method of working in the poorer specimens
is very simple, and it pays the "faker" to sell
for &pound;2 or &pound;3 what takes, perhaps, only half a day
to produce. When a well-executed picture is produced
it is worth money, but so far I have seen none,
except at the Royal School of Needlework, where
the copying of old pictures of the period is exceedingly
well done, and not intended to deceive.
The prices, however, are almost prohibitive, as no
modern needlework picture is worth from &pound;15 to
&pound;30. They are, after all, only copies, and in no
sense of the word works of art.</p>

<p>During the eighteenth century, also, a fashion set
in of adorning engravings with pieces of cloth, silk,
and tinsel. At best it was a stupid fancy, and was
responsible for the destruction of many fine old mezzotints
and coloured prints. The hands, face, and background
of an engraving were cut out, and pasted on
a sheet of cardboard, pieces of some favourite brocaded
gown, perhaps, were attached to the neck and
shoulders, tiny lace tuckers were inserted, and gorgeous
jewellery was simulated by wretched bits of
tinsel trimming. The realism of the Stuart stump
picture was never so atrocious as this baleful invention,
which was as meretricious as a waxwork
show.</p>

<p>Not so popular, but far better, were the pictures
worked on white silk with black silk and hair.
There were no artistic aspirations about these&mdash;they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">{344}</a></span>
were copies in black and white of the engravings
of the day, just as a pen-and-ink or pencil copy
might be made. Very dainty stitchery was put in
them, the stronger parts of the lines being in fine
black silk, the finer and more distant being worked
in human hair of various shades from black to brown.
Occasionally golden and even white hair is used, and
the effect is often that of a faded engraving. The
silk ground on which these little pictures were
worked is, however, often cracked with age, and many
pretty specimens are ruined. The illustration shows
an example of the type of picture, and depicts
"Charlotte weeping over the Tomb of Werther."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">{345}</a></span></p>

<h2>XII<br />
<br />
NEEDLEWORK PICTURES OF THE NINETEENTH
CENTURY</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Entire decline of needlework as an art&mdash;Miss Linwood's
invention!&mdash;The Berlin-wool pictures&mdash;Lack of efficient
instruction&mdash;Waste of magnificent opportunity at South
Kensington Museum.</p></div>


<p>It were kindest to ignore 19th century needlework,
but in a book treating of English embroidery something
must be said to bridge over the time when
Needlecraft as an Art was <i>dead</i>. During the earlier
part of the century taste was bad, during the middle
it was beyond criticism, and from then to the time
of the "greenery-yallery" &aelig;sthetic revival all and
everything made by woman's fingers ought to be
buried, burnt, or otherwise destroyed. Indeed, if
that drastic process could be carried out from the
time good Queen Adelaide reigned to the early
"eighties" we might not, now and ever, have to
bow our heads in utter abjection.</p>

<p>The originator and moving spirit of this bad
period was Miss Linwood, who conceived the idea
of copying oil paintings in woolwork. She died<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">{350}</a></span>
in 1845. Would that she had never been born!
When we think of the many years which English
women have spent over those wickedly hideous
Berlin-wool pictures, working their bad drawing and
vilely crude colours into those awful canvases, and
imagining that they were earning undying fame as
notable women for all the succeeding ages, death
was too good for Miss Linwood. The usual boiling
oil would have been a fitter end! Miss Linwood
made a great <i>furore</i> at the time of her invention,
and held an exhibition in the rooms now occupied
by Messrs. Puttick &amp; Simpson, Leicester Square.
Can we not imagine the shade of the great Sir
Joshua Reynolds, whose home and studio these
rooms had been, revisiting the glimpses of the moon,
and while wandering up and down that famous old
staircase forsaking his home for ever after one horrified
glance at Miss Linwood's invention?</p>

<p>Not only Miss Linwood, but Mrs. Delany and
Miss Knowles made themselves famous for Berlin-wool
pictures. The kindest thing to say is that
the specimens which are supposed to have been
worked by their own hands are considerably
better than those of the half-dozen generations of
their followers. During the middle and succeeding
twenty years of the nineteenth century the notable
housewife of every class amused herself, at the
expense of her mind, by working cross-stitch pictures
with crudely coloured wools (royal blue and
rose-pink, magenta, emerald-green, and deep crimson
were supposed to represent the actual colours
of Nature), on very coarse canvas. Landseer's paint<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">{351}</a></span>ings
were favourite studies, "Bolton Abbey in the
Olden Times" lending itself to a choice range of
violent colours and striking incidents. Nothing was
too sacred for the Berlin-wool worker to lay hands
upon. "The Crucifixion," "The Nativity," "The
Flight into Egypt," "The Holy Family" were not
only supposed to show the skill of the worker, but
also the proper frame of mind the embroideress
possessed. Pleasing little horrors such as the "Head
of the Saviour in His Agony," and that of the
Virgin with all her tortured mother love in her
eyes were considered fit ornaments for drawing-room,
which by the way were also adorned with
wool and cotton crochet antimacassars, waxwork
flowers under glass, and often astonishingly good
specimens of fine Chelsea, Worcester, and Oriental
china.</p>

<p>Never was the questions of how "having eyes and
yet seeing not" more fully exemplified. The nation
abounded in paintings, prints, fine needlework, and
the product of our greatest period of porcelain
manufacture. Fine examples were at hand everywhere.
Exquisite prints belonging to our only good
period, the eighteenth century, were common; yet
rather than try their skill in copying these, the
needlewomen, who possessed undoubted skill, enthusiasm,
and infinite patience, preferred to copy realistic
paintings of the Landseer school and the highly
coloured prints of the Baxter and Le Blond
period.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the craze is by no means buried.
Within the last twelve months I was invited to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">{352}</a></span>
the "works" of a wonderful needlewoman in a little
Middlesex village. The local clergyman and doctor
were sufficiently benighted even in these days of
universal culture to admire her work, and her fame
had spread. Room after room was filled with 10
by 8-feet canvases; every drawer in the house was
crammed with the result of this clever woman's
work&mdash;for clever she undoubtedly was. After
exhausting all the known subjects of Landseer
and his school, she had struck out a line for herself,
and had copied the <i>Graphic</i> and <i>Illustrated London
News</i> Supplements of the stirring scenes from the
South African War, such as "The Siege of Ladysmith,"
"The Death of the Prince Imperial" in all
its gruesome local colouring, were worked on gigantic
canvases. Her great <i>chef d'&oelig;uvre</i> was, however, the
memorial statue of Queen Victoria, copied from the
<i>Graphic</i> Supplement <i>in tones of black, white, and
grey</i>, a most clever piece of work; but&mdash;well, she
was happy and more than delighted with my perfectly
honest remark that I had <i>never seen anything
like it</i>!</p>

<p>Ah! if only this dear woman and the many
others who are wasting their time and eyesight over
fashions which perish could only be reached and
aroused by the influence of the lovely old English
stitchery of our great period! If only the purblind
authorities and custodians of our National collections
could awaken to the infinite possibilities which they
hold, once again "Opus Anglicum" might rule the
world, and the labour of even one woman's life might
be of lasting value. It is useless to refer to the many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">{353}</a></span>
schools of embroidery there are in different parts
of the country, where fine work is being done on the
best lines. These schools, from the Royal School of
Needlework downwards, are "closed corners," and
no attempt is made to reach the great public. The
Royal School of Needlework is maintained by no
subsidy as it ought to be, but by the many ladies of
position and taste who liberally support it, both
for the instruction and employment of "ladies of
reduced circumstances," and for <i>the disposal of its
work at very high prices</i>. Other schools in town are
simply private adventure institutions, run at a
considerable profit to the principals.</p>

<p>The superb collection at South Kensington might
as well be buried in the crypt of Westminster
Cathedral for all the value it is to the general
public. There is not the slightest attempt to allow
these unique pieces of "Opus Anglicum" to point
a moral or adorn a tale. The magnificent copes
and vestments, of which there are some score, are
merely tabulated, paragraphed, and photographed,
and there is an end of them. During my constant
visits to these treasures of English Art I have
not once discovered another interested visitor
amongst these beautiful vestments; and the officials,
when interviewed, though perfectly courteous,
apparently resent inquiries; and woe betide the
unfortunate inquirers who <i>might</i> have found the
required information from the tiny little printed card
hidden either too low or too high in the dark
recesses of the corridors, and so spared these <i>savants</i>
the trouble of an interview!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">{354}</a></span></p>

<p>Why a continuous course of lectures on this and
every kindred Art subject is not made compulsory
at the Victoria and Albert Museum is one of the
burning questions of the hour among the cultured
collectors of the day. The custodians are supposed
to be men of special insight in the branches over
which they preside, yet for all the advantage to the
public they might as well be waxwork dummies.
What we want as a nation is "culture while we
wait," and writ so large that those who run may
read, and until this consummation is attained we
shall ever remain in the Slough of Despond, and Art
for Art's sake will continue dead.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">{355}</a></span></p>

<br />
EMBROIDERY IN "COSTUME"</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Early Greek garments&mdash;Biblical references to embroidery&mdash;Ecclesiastical
garments&mdash;Eighteenth-century dresses,
coats, and waistcoats&mdash;Muslin embroideries.</p></div>


<p>The subject of Costume has been most admirably
treated in another volume of this series, but a reference
must be made to it as affecting our topic,
English Embroidery, as costume has played no little
part in its history.</p>

<p>From the earliest ages embroidery has been used
to decorate garments. The ancient Greeks embroidered
the hems of their graceful draperies in
the well-known Greek fret and other designs so
invariably seen on the old Greek vases. The legend
that Minerva herself taught the Greeks the art of
embroidery illustrates how deeply the art was
understood; and the pretty story told by an old
botanist of how the foxglove came by its name and
its curious bell-like flowers is worth repeating. In
the old Greek days, when gods and goddesses were
regarded as having the attributes of humanity in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">{358}</a></span>
addition to those of deities, Juno was one day
amusing herself with making tapestry, and, after the
manner of the people, put a thimble on her finger.
Jupiter, "playing the rogue with her," took her
thimble and threw it away, and down it dropped
to the earth. The goddess was very wroth, and in
order to pacify her Jupiter turned the thimble
into a flower, which now is known as Digitalis, or
finger-stole.</p>

<p>This little fairy tale can scarcely be taken as
proof conclusive of the existence of either needle
tapestry or thimble use, but its telling may amuse
the reader.</p>

<p>In all ancient histories we find continuous references
to the embroidered garment worn by its
people. It was well recognised that no material
was sufficiently beautiful not to be further embellished
with rich embroideries. In the Psalms we
find that "Pharaoh's daughter shall be brought to
the king in a raiment of needlework," and that "her
clothing is of wrought gold."</p>

<p>Phrygia was above all the country most noted for
embroideries of gold, and for many years the name
"Phrygian embroidery" was sufficient to describe
any highly decorated specimen. It is said that the
name of the vestment or trimming, the "orphry"
is derived from the word "Auri-phrygium," meaning
"gold of Phrygian embroidery."</p>

<p>The Phrygians are credited with having taught
the Egyptians the art, while the Hebrews, while
sojourning in the land of Egypt, learned the art
from their captors, and carried it with them all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">{359}</a></span>
through their journeys to the Promised Land, and
their final settlement in Palestine. The mention of
gold and purple embroideries, both as garments and
hangings, is conspicuous throughout all Bible
history. The Egyptian and Greek arts are in
almost all respects concurrent. The Ph&oelig;nicians
carried examples of each country's work from one
to another. After the conquest of Greece the
Romans absorbed her art, and developed it in their
own special style. They in turn carried their arts
and crafts to Gaul and Britain, and by degrees
needlecraft permeated the whole of Europe.</p>

<p>Dealing with the embroidered costumes of our
own country, the ancient records, illuminated
Missals, and other contemporary data show that
very sumptuous were both the ecclesiastical and
lay garments. Heavy gold embroideries were
worked on the hems of skirts and mantles. The
Kings' coronation robes and mantles were beautiful
specimens of handicraft, often after a king's death
being given to the churches for vestments. From
Anglo-Saxon to Norman times extensive use was
made of the work of the needle for clothing,
but after the Conquest till quite late in the Tudor
period little has been found to throw light upon
the use of embroidery for the lay dress of the time.
All woman's taste and energy seem to have been
devoted to make monumental embroideries for
church use.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, not until the gorgeous period of
Henry VIII. that embroidery, as distinct from
garment-making, appeared; and then everything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">{360}</a></span>
became an object worthy of decoration. Much
fine stitchery was put into the fine white undergarments
of that time, and the overdresses of
both men and women became stiff with gold
thread and jewels. Much use was made of slashing
and quilting, the point of junction being dotted
with pearls and precious stones. Noble ladies
wore dresses heavily and richly embroidered with
gold, and the train was so weighty that train-bearers
were pressed into service. In the old
paintings the horses belonging to kings and nobles
wear trappings of heavily embroidered gold. Even
the hounds who are frequently represented with
their masters have collars massively decorated with
gold bullion.</p>

<p>The skirts of the ladies of this time were thickly
encrusted with jewels, folds of silk being crossed
in a kind of lattice-work, each crossing being fixed
with a pearl or jewel, and a similar precious stone
being inserted in the square formed by the trellis.
The long stomachers were one gleaming mass of
jewelled embroidery, the tiny caps or headdresses
being likewise heavily studded with gems.</p>

<p>During the reign of Charles I. a much daintier
style of dress appeared. Velvet and silken suits
were worn by the men, handsomely but appropriately
trimmed with the fine "punto in aria"
or Reticella laces of Venice; and in this and
the three succeeding reigns dress was of sumptuous
velvets, satins, and heavy silks, unembroidered,
but trimmed, and in Charles II.'s time <i>loaded</i> with
costly laces. It will be noted that whenever lace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">{361}</a></span>
is in the ascendant, embroidery suffers, as is quite
natural. Lace itself is sufficient adornment for
fine raiment.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">{363}</a></span>As the use of the fine Venetian and Flemish
and French laces declined, and tuckers and frillings
of Mechlin, Valenciennes, and Point d'Angleterre
appeared, the use of embroidery asserted itself, and
the pretty satins and daintily coloured silks of
William and Mary, Queen Anne, and more specially
the earlier Georges, began to be embroidered in a
specially delicate fashion. Fine floss silk was used in
soft colourings, and whole surfaces were covered with
tiny embroidered sprays of natural-coloured flowers.
Really exquisite stitchery was put into the graceful
honeysuckle, the pansy, carnation, and rose clusters
which decorated the dresses. The bodices, sacques,
and skirts of the early eighteenth-century ladies
were embroidered with real artistic taste and feeling.
Some of the old dresses kept at South Kensington
show the exquisite specimens of this class of
needlework; while the coats and waistcoats of the
sterner sex are not a whit behind the feminine
garments in beauty. The long waistcoats were
most frequently made of cream, pale blue, or white
silk or satin, delightfully embroidered with tiny
sprays of blossoms, and fastened with fine old paste
buttons; while the coat, frequently of brocade, was
heavily embroidered down the front with three or
four inches of solid embroidery of foliage and flowers,
oftentimes mixed with gold and silver threads. The
tiny cravat of Mechlin, cuff ruffles, knee breeches,
silken hose, and buckled shoes, along with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">{364}</a></span>
powdered hair, complete a costume that has never
been equalled, either before or afterwards, in beauty,
grace, and elegance. During the William IV. and
the long Victorian period, with the exception of
a very fine embroidery on muslin, in the earlier
part of it, nothing but fine stitchery for the use of
underwear was made, if we except the hundreds
and thousands of yards of cut and buttonholed
linen which seemed to have been the solace and
delight of our grandmothers when they allowed
themselves to be torn away from their beloved Berlin-wool
work. To sit on a cushion and sew a fine
seam appears to have been the amusement of the
properly constituted women of the early and mid-nineteenth
century.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">{365}</a></span></p>

<h2>XIV<br />
<br />
SALE PRICES</h2>


<p>Ancient embroideries so seldom come into the salerooms
that it is rarely an opportunity occurs for
obtaining market prices, therefore Lady Wolseley's
sale on July 12, 1906, must be accepted as a standard.
Immense prices are asked at the antique
shops, the dealers apparently basing their prices
on this sale by auction and <i>doubling</i> them. I
have visited every shop in the trade in search of
prices for this book before procuring the auctioneer's
catalogue, and was aghast at the terrific
sums asked for oftentimes indifferent specimens
in comparison to what was paid in the auction-room.
During the past year anything from
&pound;15 15s. to &pound;40 has been paid at Christie's for
specimens of varying degrees of perfection of work
and condition. The latter state is even of greater
importance than the first, as no matter how good the
work originally, if discoloured and frayed, prices go
down and down. Nearly all the finest specimens
of the Stump-work period are marred by the
tarnishing of the gold and silver threads. Instead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">{368}</a></span>
of these being a glory and a great enhancement to
the embroidery, they prove a great disfigurement,
and thereby cause a considerable reduction in value.</p>

<p>The earlier petit point pictures, having little or
no bullion in their execution (and when cared for
and not exposed to too much sunlight), have kept
their condition very well, and now are quite the
favourite kind for collection. It speaks much for
the quality of the silks used and the dyes of nearly
three hundred years ago that the fugitive greens and
blues and delicate roses in these little works of art,
as in the superb tapestries of the same date, should
be as fine as when made, whereas to-day's colours
are as fleeting as the glories of the rainbow.</p>

<h2>XV<br />
<br />
CONCLUSION</h2>


<p>Needlework as a national art is as dead as the
proverbial door-nail; whether or not it ever regains
its position as a craft is a matter of conjecture.
Personally, I incline to the belief that it is absolutely
extinct. The death-knell rang for all time when the
sewing-machine was invented. The machine has
been a very doubtful blessing, as it has allowed even
the art of stitchery in ordinary work to slide into
the limbo of forgotten things. What woman now
knows what it is to "back-stitch" a shirt cuff, for
instance, drawing a thread for guidance, and carefully
going back two or three threads in order to
make a neat, firm line of stitching? The sewing-machine
does all this, and <i>does</i> it <i>well</i>, a clever
machinist turning out more work in a week than
a seamstress in a year. If this were all, it would
be no matter for regret, but with the necessity for
needlework has vanished the desire. The lady
quoted in Green's History is now non-existent.
"She was a pattern of sobriety unto many, very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">{376}</a></span>
seldom seen abroad except at church; when others
recreated themselves at holidays and other times, she
would take her needlework, and say, 'Here is my
recreation.'"</p>

<p>In spite of the many Schools of Embroidery, with
a few notable exceptions, nothing is done to raise the
standard of embroidery above making miserable little
cushion-covers, table-centres, and suchlike pretty
fripperies for the temporary adornment of the house.
The women of Germany, Holland, Sweden, Italy, on
the contrary, take a great interest in the embroidery
of the bed and table linen and the really artistic embroidery
of their national costumes. Nothing of this
is seen in England. Table linen is bought <i>ready
hemmed</i> at the shop. Dainty tea-cloths and serviettes
are purchased ready embroidered (by machine) and
trimmed with machine-made lace. Even <i>lingerie</i>
of all classes is machine-made and bought by the
dozen, instead of being made by the daughters of
the house.</p>

<p>The only hope of a revival lies in the various Art
schools in the country where designing for fine embroidery
and lace is encouraged. Unfortunately,
however, equal facilities are offered for designing
of machine-made imitations. The Royal School of
Needlework, not being a Government institution,
offers no encouragement to outsiders. It is in the
hands of a number of ladies, who manage it as
they will; and although very fine work is accomplished,
they trust too much to modern designers
and artists who work out their own pet theories and
hobbies. If only they would put aside all theories<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">{377}</a></span>
and new ideas, and <i>go back</i> to the best periods of
English art both for their designs and execution, even
yet, with the intelligent use of the glorious examples
in the adjoining Museum, much might be done to
revivify this expiring art.</p>
